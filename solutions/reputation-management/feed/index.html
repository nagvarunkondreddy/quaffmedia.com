				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before the US elections of 2016, I spent a month travelling to meet people in various parts of that country. As an outsider, my reading of the Trump phenomenon was very different from what I was hearing from those around me. I had a strong gut feeling that he was becoming a mouthpiece for sentiments that many Americans related to but never expressed openly. Until now, political correctness along with all the other constraints of a society that wants to be viewed as progressive and democratic had kept many of these sentiments at bay. But Trump was tapping into something very fundamental – a deep-seated sense of fear and anxiety among people. It was a palpable phenomenon. One could feel its currents in the air. But everyone I spoke to denied that it was a real one. They felt it was impossible that somebody with his temperament could become the leader of the ‘free world’.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we feel about the outcome of that election, it does reaffirm the value of gut instincts. This is neither a new nor a revolutionary concept. History is littered with examples of effective leaders who were adept at reading the pulse of their audiences. Clearly, technology is not the most critical factor in this exercise. That is not to suggest that the miraculous digital tools at our disposal are not really helping. But we cannot dismiss the value of personal relationships and human contact in the midst of all this. Now more than ever, there is a need to understand and acknowledge behaviors and motivations – in situations that are not entirely familiar to us. We have to accept that our reality may be very different from someone else’s.</p>
<p>Leaders who fail to recognize that fact may find themselves on a slippery slope. Take the general restrained reaction to the challenges of demonetization in the country. Those who do not feel its pain on a daily basis are presuming that everybody across the country feels the same way. But maybe the reaction from rural India is muted because its residents lack platforms to express their fears and concerns. What happens when and if those floodgates open?</p>
<p>Similarly, businesses that build their products and services based on a limited worldview will see this strategy backfiring on them sooner or later. We cannot develop a cohesive strategy around the behavior of a small segment of the population that thinks and acts as we do. It is important to examine various strata and sub-groups within the target market in order to uncover their pain points, motivations, habits and more. This exercise will open our minds to a reality that is different from what we experience and live on a daily basis. If the events of 2016 have taught us anything, it is the importance of listening for more than just the reinforcing signals of our private bubbles.</p>
<p>Listening – truly listening – to your customer requires time, effort and money. But there is no substitute for it in today’s reality. Yet, many companies keep forging ahead – with blinders on – and are then surprised to find the ground shifting from underneath them.</p>
<p>The other key challenge for leaders and businesses lies in building authentic narratives in the midst of so much noise. We are surrounded by un-validated views and news that are being amplified – through various echo chambers – to an audience that is not really thinking for itself. In an age of increasing cynicism, the very platforms designed for authentic communication have lost their sheen and credibility. The word ‘authentic’ itself has become loaded to the extent where it is hard to know what it means any more.</p>
<p>A leader who chooses to be a loose cannon on twitter, for example, may be viewed as authentic by some and rashly impulsive by others. It is possible that such public airing of opinion – without active control and curation – is the new normal in the world today. There is a lot more pressure for leaders to navigate and figure out where the boundaries lie in all of this. What is clear is that there is very low tolerance now for communication that is superficial or sanitized. We need to find ways to bring the heart into it. If it strikes an emotional chord in people, then it is more likely to be viewed as both authentic and effective. I found a good example of this recently in a heartfelt letter by the CEO of a multinational pharma company in which he expressed his anguish with predatory pricing and other questionable practices in the industry and described how his organization aimed to counter these.</p>
<p>We live in times when a single event can disrupt the status quo in an instant. A recent example of this can be found in the way the fortunes of one mainstream newspaper – the Hindustan Times – nosedived overnight. Its business model, already weakened by the digital revolution, crumbled under the weight of demonetization. Being alert to such threats is increasingly important for an organization.</p>
<p>There are also some fundamental aspects of our lives that appear to be under siege. One involves freedom of the press and, at a broader level, freedom of speech. Safeguarding these freedoms was always critical and is even more so now. The second aspect – the right to privacy – is something we have to debate in a clear-eyed manner. While Facebook and Google are among the biggest purveyors of data, government mandates to get broad access to it can change the landscape dramatically. Should we surrender all data to the government of the day who is neither building nor intending to build checks and balances to protect it? It is important to be conscious of these developments in our environment and to scrutinize them for both intent and impact.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, reputation management in today’s reality involves getting back to basics. We also have to realize that we cannot base all our decisions on pure data. Human connections are as important today as they were before the digital revolution. Forging and cultivating these will still be key in an era of technological and business disruption.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram:  Inspiring pride</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is the primary civic agency which provides the residents of Gurugram with civic services. These include  maintenance of parks, drains, public toilets and other public places, property tax collection, application for trade licenses, registration of marriages, births and deaths, construction and maintenance of municipal markets, fire brigade services, solid waste management and planting of trees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The authorities at MCG were finding it hard to implement their directives in Gurugram, as the residents weren’t being cooperative. Things came to a head when the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs conducted a Swachh Survekshan Survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign was very well received. The posts, videos and jingles were liked and shared by a large audience and received much appreciation.  In fact, some of the posts were even retweeted and reposted by Swachh Survekshan Urban, Swachh Bharat Mission and other prominent bodies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">MCG roped in The PRactice to spread the message of hygiene and cleanliness, and to inspire pride in the neighbourhood. A study of the problem showed that the residents weren’t convinced about MCG’s efficiency. We realised that MCG was in dire need of <b>Reputation Management. </b>It needed to be perceived as efficient and responsive.  To achieve our objective, we adopted a 360-degree approach and incorporated elements from our integrated offerings including <b>Strategic Media Relations, Digital Engagement </b>and on-ground activation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our press releases on Swachh Survekshan received 20+ coverages and accounted for almost 60% of tier 1 publications. In addition, we designed social media campaigns through which we involved larger audiences, leaders and influencers in Gurugram to promote cleanliness in the city and participate in Swachh Survekshan.  As part of our</p>
<p><b>Stakeholder Engagement</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">programme, we identified various stakeholder cohorts comprising local influencers. We created a bilingual communication campaign using jingles, posters, social media posts, cartoons, etc to ensure public participation. The campaign was very well received. The posts, videos and jingles were liked and shared by a large audience and received much appreciation.  In fact, some of the posts were even retweeted and reposted by Swachh Survekshan Urban, Swachh Bharat Mission and other prominent bodies.</p>

Siemens, a global engineering group, approached The PRactice to strengthen their position in industrial digitalization, automation and electrification space within the Indian industry. The task was to reinforce and amplify their competencies in these areas; to magnify their new agile, Industry 4.0 identity.  The company wanted to be more aligned to the digital revolution transforming industry worldwide.</p>
<blockquote><p> Over the course of a year, the spotlight of the discourses around Siemens shifted to digitalization, and consequently, their share of voice in the industry spiked as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>The PRactice opted for the <b>Corporate Reputation Management</b> program that was aimed at generating awareness about Siemens’ strategic offerings in industrial digitalization. This was achieved by collaborating closely with their in-house communications team to engage with a select group of journalists. The focus was on CAT-A publications, and long-format pieces that comprehensively captured the messaging on Digitalization. The first Siemens Innovation Day held in India was also leveraged to garner high-impact stories in prominent financial, mainline and trade publications.</p>
<p>
Over the course of a year, the spotlight of the discourses around Siemens shifted to digitalization, and consequently, their share of voice in the industry spiked as well. Besides this impact, a sharply focused <b>Strategic Media Relations</b> engagement plan led to brand affinity among key journalists, making Siemens a preferred choice for story inputs around digitalization and other issues surrounding Indian industry. This resulted in successfully reinforcing their transformation and leadership in the field of digitalization.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="prose">
<p>On the eighteenth of May, Zomato was hacked. In no time, social media was adrift with questions over data security and financial threat to millions of users.</p>
<p>Pressing questions were raised against the poster-boy of Indian e-commerce over its ability to keep user data safe. The reputation of one of the most loved restaurant search and discovery platforms was under fire.</p>
<p>The threat posed by cybersecurity today is more than just security. It is about reputation.</p>
<p>Last year, Yahoo! admitted unearthing a major attack that affected at least five-hundred million accounts, which the company blamed on hackers working on behalf of a government. The sequence of events prompted Verizon Communication to think of withdrawing from an agreement to buy Yahoo!&#8217;s core internet business for nearly five-billion US Dollars.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we also saw a synchronized attack with hackers taking over control of every computer of three Indian banks and a pharmaceutical company and locked them. More recently, over three million debit cards were also exposed to high-risk because of breach in the networks of some of the leading Indian banks.</p>
<p>Hackers are actively pursuing potentially damaging information, ranging from financial data (customer and internal) to trade secrets, products in development, legal and personal data, controversial documents and more.</p>
<p>At an event of a cyberattack, organizations are vulnerable of encountering a wide variety of financial costs. However, the bigger damage is the breach of stakeholder trust and a serious dent on reputation.</p>
<p>Corporate reputation management is the safeguarding of a company’s most integral asset – Reputation. It involves shaping collective perceptions and attitudes about an organization through effective stakeholder engagement. Corporate reputation management can lead to a meaningful and productive relationship between an organization and the environment in which it operates.</p>
<p>Reputation management is a journey for the long haul and is deep rooted in the way companies engage with their stakeholders over a period of time. It is a continual process of influencing stakeholders to acknowledge, appreciate and absorb the foundational tenets of an organization. It helps enhance organizational value as perceived by stakeholders and mitigates negative impact in times of crisis.</p>
<p>As we start sharing more and more of some of our most private and sensitive information with digital platforms based on trust, the degree of our personal vulnerability also increases multi-fold. Organizations and institutions collecting and recording personal data for business operations need to be better equipped to handle their vulnerabilities in current times. This can be enabled by understanding its social, economic and policy-centric environment effectively. An organization needs to identify its stakeholders in this landscape and create multiple touch-points to understand them and engage with them over a period of time.</p>
<p>A pool of influencers in the public, including from its user base, need to be built who will stand by the company as champions in case of an adverse situation. Organizations also need to move away from the culture of secrecy around cyberattacks as most hacks or hacking attempts in India are tucked under the carpet and are not disclosed. This hinders information sharing between intelligence agencies and experts to track down the “dark web” in search of miscreants.</p>
<p>At a much larger level, India needs to tackle the massive problem with pirated software, with some reports claiming more than fifty-percent software used in the country to be unauthentic. This makes it even easier for cybercriminals to access and tamper with systems and networks. Awareness and education can play an important role here, keeping internal stakeholders as a priority cohort in the engagement strategy.</p>
<p>New regulations need to be introduced for the State to stay abreast of the new world of challenges and vulnerabilities being created by highly sophisticated cybercriminals. The IT Act of India was institutionalized way back in the year-2000. In the past years, realities have changed tremendously in terms of how users engage with computing and the revolutionary connectedness of devises that has set in. Several of the companies we see today have come with disruptive new-age business models, which often present surprises at the policy level. These companies need to make proactive efforts to reach out to the upper echelons of the State decision making and bring about awareness and education about their businesses, the threats they face, and how effective policies can support them.</p>
<p>The threat of a cybersecurity breach and its impact on corporate reputation is arguably <em>the</em> issue keeping the C-Suite up at night—and it will likely be the top issue for years to come.</p>
<p>Reputation of an organization is hinged strongly on what it communicates, to who it communicates to, and where it communicates as much as its ability to adapt to response and feedback from its stakeholders. This makes it a cyclical, continual cycle.</p>
<p>Keeping cybersecurity in mind, organizations need to adopt a concerted effort to understand and address this threat in a focused and diligent manner.</p>
<p>Start with being <em>prepared</em>. Cybercriminals are increasingly getting more sophisticated in their attack pattern of venting, organizing, mobilizing and boating. Organizations need to be ahead of the curve to monitor this “deep web” with data, information and intuition to counter a breach and communicate during an attack progression. In addition, the organization needs to be prepared in the event a hacker is successful, for which you need to invest in scenario planning, communication channels and response mechanisms.</p>
<p>In case a breach occurs, you need to <em>manage</em> it effectively and with speed. A crisis management and communication team needs to be well strongly in place to respond and navigate through the chaos that comes in at the time of a cyberattack. There are two aspects that need to be addressed in such situations – countering the attack and managing the communication. Both requires information to be churned out and analysed in real-time. This is where your champions in the stakeholder universe will count the most.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>restoration</em>. The post-breach process needs to be directed to restore confidence in the organization and rebuild the corporate reputation. You may get the impression that this is a sequential final stage, but this actually flows through the entire process right from the time a cyberattack breaks out. Transparency and frequency is at the crux of this communication. The stronger the engagement and trust has been in the stakeholder universe, the quicker the turnaround is expected to be.</p>
<p>Safeguarding corporate reputation in the cyberage needs a holistic understanding and approach. Organizations need to be ahead of the curve at all times making sure we are equipped to prepare, manage and restore. Proactive stakeholder engagement can go a long way in equipping the organization achieve the same.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bengaluru International Airport Limited, (BIAL) is located in the city’s suburban area. In May 2008, it replaced the old HAL Airport which was located within city limits. Although it was on par with the best of international airports, the new airport initially faced flak from anti-BIAL lobbies, the public, flyers, sections of the media and others with vested interests. In the middle of this anti-BIAL blitzkrieg, The PRactice was brought on board to improve perceptions and establish a positive corporate reputation for the client. We studied existing conversations in parallel forums and realised that most of them were based on half-truths. We advised the client to launch a communication campaign which debunked the myths and half-truths. We launched a simple, yet credible </span><b>Strategic Media Relations </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">program, ‘Seeing Is Believing’, as part of which, influential bloggers and journalists were offered free trips to the airport, to have a first-hand experience of BIAL. What resulted was that bloggers and journalists started writing about the positive experience. Myths were shattered, and the truth emerged.  When the airport was inaugurated amidst much fanfare and support from the media and public at large, The PRactice was acknowledged as a key facilitator, by the client. ​ We went on to partner with BIAL and build the client’s reputation through a </span><b>Digital Engagement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programme for many years.  Leveraging our rich experience in </span><b>Public Relations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we effectively managed BIAL’s reputation as one of the most professionally run private-public partnerships in the country. </span></p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006, Qualcomm woke up to news that Reliance Communications had decided to shut down its CDMA business. Reliance pointed to the royalties being paid to Qualcomm as the main reason for the non-profitability of running a CDMA network. Without warning, Qualcomm found itself in the eye of a storm and The PRactice stepped in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The objective of the communications campaign was to dispel misconceptions about Qualcomm’s business model and reassure key stakeholders of the strong growth of CDMA and WCDMA worldwide. The challenge was to address concerns surrounding royalties and handset pricing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To stop the spread of erroneous information, The PRactice conceptualized a unified and coordinated communications strategy that was transparent, straightforward and aggressive. A webcast of Qualcomm’s business model was conducted within two days. One-on-one media interactions were held with important spokespeople. Even the CEO of Qualcomm addressed the media and cleared doubts regarding the business model and royalties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcripts were sent to the publication after every interaction. This ensured there was no room for ambiguity or misquotes. In the following weeks, the message was reiterated over and over again in the media, clarifying Qualcomm’s views in the telecom space. The crisis slowly eased off and before you knew it, everything went back to normal at Qualcomm.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), known for their hugely successful line of PC microprocessors, were launching their ATI Radeon series of graphic cards in India. This was a big moment for AMD, as the Radeon 4800 series was truly groundbreaking for its time. It had the power of delivering cinema-quality video gaming experiences, and every gaming enthusiast in the country was eagerly awaiting its release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice was given the mandate of launching these cutting-edge devices and positioning AMD as a true thought leader in taking cinema and gaming to the next level. AMD had demonstrated its cinema 2.0 experience in San Francisco earlier, saying “You won’t just play movies, you will play in them”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice conceptualized the idea of Bollywood 2.0, an event where the audience would be treated to a cinema-realistic, Bollywood gaming experience. The event was organized in Mumbai and was attended by prominent journalists and reviewers, who were astounded by the demonstration. Also in attendance were industry experts Jules Urbach, and Vishal Gondal, who highlighted how this technology will open doors for the most compelling entertainment experiences ever. A separate session was also arranged for reviewers and product samples were circulated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result was better than anyone expected, with all major dailies, trade magazines and online publications carrying large feature stories on the product, calling it “Return of the Radeon”. Key technology review magazines like CHIP, PC World, PC Quest, DIGIT, Living Digital and Tech Tree were totally bowled over by the card’s capabilities. The ATI Radeon 4870 card managed to secure the ‘Best Graphic Card’ title in GPU shoot-outs conducted by these magazines. Following this, the card was also featured on NDTV in the ‘Next Big Thing’ show.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMD is a Sunnyvale-based multinational company that manufactures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">microprocessors and related technologies for business and consumer markets. Known for its commitment to customer-focused innovation and for putting the real needs of people ahead of technical one-upmanship, AMD wanted to further understand stakeholder perceptions and expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice initiated a perception survey across geographies with stakeholders from the media, bloggers analysts, OEMs, channel partners, individual buyers, enterprise buyers, gamers, developers and academia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey findings revealed that stakeholders were dissatisfied at different levels. Shaky credibility levels, insufficient public awareness, poor after-sales service and lack of clarity among the channel partners were some of the highlights thrown up by the survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reinforce the brand’s credibility, The PRactice recommended and ran a channel campaign which included profiling of the channel partner leadership teams, joint press releases by the partners, chat sessions and aggressive outreach programs for the new channel head, carrying a positive upbeat message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strategic advertising campaign was conducted to build awareness, and instead of reactive random responses from the company, The PRactice recommended the creation of a group email id which would facilitate a two way conversation between the channel partners and the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of the intervention was immediate. Positive feedback from the media and stakeholders began to emerge across platforms. The strategy was to impact change and the mission was accomplished, much to the satisfaction of the client.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Changing government perception to help gain market share. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the start of the millennium, the microprocessor industry was dominated by two companies &#8211; Intel and AMD. In India, technology adoption and upgradation at the government level began only in 2003, with the launch of the National E-governance Plan (NeGP). However, the Government’s lack of technical understanding led to making uninformed decisions in the purchase of computers at the microprocessor level.  As a result, tenders denoted brand names (against the rules of procurement laid down by the Govt. of India) such as “Intel Pentium” as a requirement without realizing that Intel is not a generic name but a brand name and that there are other options such as AMD. This situation became a huge obstacle in AMD’s sales strategy to gain market share within this vertical. It could not participate in a bulk of government tenders as changing a government tender once floated was near impossible. Numerous visits to government agencies had proven unfruitful as decisions were slow and caught up in red tape. Globally, AMD has been a victim of monopolistic practices; however in India, it was felt that the bias was a result of unfair trade practices as well as lack of proper awareness.</p>
<p><b>Description of the Work</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice realized the need to create a movement within the journalist community that will pressure government agencies to follow fair trade practices which often meant increased savings and/or better technology. Along with the  client, we spent a significant amount of time building relationships with and educating a small but well chosen set of journalists who would take on this charge. While the journalists began tracking government tenders on their own and reaching out to AMD for its comments, we shifted our efforts to build a case study that clearly demonstrated the value of engaging in fair trade. Finally, to further highlight the cost and technology benefits of buying an AMD microprocessor as opposed to an Intel microprocessor, The PRactice began positioning AMD as the partner of choice for the Government’s IT projects. </span></p>
<p><b>Outcome</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 90% of tenders were awarded to AMD in January 2008, and by January 2009 80% of the tenders were given to AMD (Approximately, an additional business opportunity worth Rs. 2400 crore or USD 500 million).  Apart from this, the campaign was successful in creating three torch bearers for fair trade in the leading dailies. They began keeping track of all major government tenders and would frequently get in touch with AMD to check if it’s open to them.  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMD is a Sunnyvale-based multinational company that manufactures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">microprocessors and related technologies for business and consumer markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Public Relations partners of AMD in India, The PRactice conducted a qualitative research across geographies, among various stakeholders of the company to understand current perceptions about AMD. Results showed that there were gaps in the company’s approach towards managing its different stakeholders.  </span></p>
<p>The PRactice proposed a strategic, customised perception audit to modify AMD’s approach to stakeholders that would lead to the desired perception.</p>
<p>The initiatives, largely among channel partners and the media, were, increased interaction with channel partners, channel partner profiling, joint press releases, chat sessions with the channel head, aggressive outreach for the new and effective channel head, and building awareness of AMD’s channel initiatives.</p>
<p>The PRactice recommended that a new email address be used by partners to provide direct feedback to the company.</p>
<p>The PRactice also leveraged relationships with leading online publications so that channel partners could engage with AMD’s stakeholders. This was strengthened by an aggressive media campaign highlighting AMD’s commitment to their partners’ success. Additionally, based on a media ask for additional information from the company, The PRactice initiated a direct mailer titled ‘An Update’ to a select group of target journalists.</p>
<p>The campaign also sought to improve advertising, enable direct and focused outreach to members of the gaming community and develop a more effective online strategy for the company.</p>
<p>The Public Relations campaign achieved a significant image shift for AMD in the eyes of the media and its partners. For example, since AMD lacked a platform to express their opinions, channel partners started supporting AMD by placing comments on their channel and other websites, in response to news on AMD. Surveys conducted after the campaign indicated that the previous issues of inadequate communication and support had been addressed and AMD was recognized for its timely updates and multiple initiatives aimed at educating its partners.</p>
