The Handloom School (THS) is a non-profit organization born of the need to preserve India’s handloom industry which is under threat. When power looms were introduced and mass-produced textiles became more commercially viable, they grabbed a huge market share.  Unfortunately, this spelt doom for the traditional handloom weavers of India. Many weavers started looking at alternate livelihoods. Handloom weaving became a dying art. THS intervened and developed a specialized education program for young weavers. The idea was to bring handloom weavers back to the fold and to bridge the gap between traditional weaving and new competencies. </p>
<p>
To get recognition for this program, THS had to promote its case to relevant stakeholders and get their support.  THS identified The PRactice as the perfect partner to reach out to people and organizations who could further the cause. </p>
<blockquote><p>The organic, no-marketing-dollars-spent Social Media campaign was hugely liked by readers and the engagement grew by 800%. The weavers of The Handloom School received orders worth Rs.13 lakhs during the fashion week. </p></blockquote>
<p>
As part of our Stakeholder Engagement program, we identified  The Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) as a key influencer and made a pitch to promote handloom weaves from Maheshwar. The Director of FDCI was convinced by our pitch and THS was offered complimentary participation in the Amazon India Fashion Week (AIFW), 2017. We went the extra mile and initiated a parallel tie-up with Good Earth who agreed to sponsor the event. The collection was presented at Amazon Fashion Week, as the lead ramp show on March 15th, 2017. </p>
<p>
Our strategy included <b>Message Development, Strategic Media Relations, Digital Engagement, Communication Design and Stakeholder Engagement </b> as solutions. The outcome was incredible. Leading publications carried detailed stories about India’s unique handloom art. Over 98 lakh impressions were generated! The organic, no-marketing-dollars-spent Social Media campaign was hugely liked by readers and the engagement grew by 800%. As a result of the activities, awareness grew, and the weavers of The Handloom School received orders worth Rs.13 lakhs during the fashion week. What’s more,  the WomenWeave Charitable Trust also worked with us to launch of a collection of handwoven textiles.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While contributing a piece to talk about effective management of CSR projects, I thought that we need to take a step back. It is heartening to see that governments and civil society across the world have taken up the responsibility to proactively work towards the development of the underprivileged. Billions have been allocated, spent (or even misspent) in development projects across the world.</p>
<p>India became the first country in the world to make a corporate commitment for CSR mandatory for companies beyond a certain threshold.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4971 size-full" src="http://staging.the-practice.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0003_System-thinking-for-development.png" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://the-practice.net/wpr2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0003_System-thinking-for-development.png 750w, https://the-practice.net/wpr2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0003_System-thinking-for-development-300x200.png 300w, https://the-practice.net/wpr2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0003_System-thinking-for-development-350x234.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />We are certainly in the right direction in terms of attitude, legislation and participation. However, to make interventions in the development sector work, we need more than that. We need effective strategies, efficient execution and robust measurements. This is not easy.</p>
<p>Hence, I am sharing my own take on effective management of CSR projects, or more generally, development projects. Given the nuances and intricacies, the development sector presents, I am sharing my thoughts in a three-part series to present why systems thinking is essential in this sector. This first piece will focus on introducing the concept of systems thinking and its relevance, the second one will talk about how it can be applied for design, execution and measurement of development sector work, and the final piece will highlight some of the skill sets required for a systems interventionist and its related challenges.</p>
<p>When we speak of working in the development sector, what typically comes to our mind is poverty, education, backward classes/casts, health, sanitation, water, so on and so forth. It is common to see funds being allocated to specific areas such as these, but what is more important is to understand how many (or all) of these areas interact with one another and how an individual is impacted in the ecosystem he/she is in.</p>
<p>Let’s consider Baahubali (I picked up a trending name), who lives in a village near a chemical company and works for the same company. He is poor and the company has allocated CSR funds for the education of the village, for which Baahubali’s son is a beneficiary. But the child (Baahubali’s son) drinks untreated water from the river nearby as he does not have a water purifier at home. The water is severely contaminated because of the chemical company, where Baahubali is employed, flushes its industrial waste into the river. Baahubali’s wife is a small-time fisherwoman and is now out of business as the contaminated water of the river has over the years killed most of the fish in the river. Baahubali’s son constantly falls ill due to drinking contaminated water and all the family earnings go in his treatments, and eventually, he has to drop out of school. Similar was the case with other families. The company eventually stopped its funds for education in the village as their measurement metrics showed a drop of student enrolment in schools over time. Several families in the village had similar experience leading to increasing deprivation, and antisocial behaviour. A village that has lived in poverty for generations is now being pushed into a bleak future of more abject poverty and dissonance.</p>
<p>So what did you notice? The CSR funds of the company that was going for education is a complete waste. Not only could the company do anything to educate the children in the village, but also made the situation worse for them by contaminating the river.</p>
<p>Let’s get more local for India – consider families in abject poverty taking small loans from moneylenders, indebted for life and constantly being harassed for payments. Add caste. Add no toilets. Add violence against women and children. The list never ends.</p>
<p>This is a complex problem. Complex problems cannot be solved by allocating money for CSR. This needs a very different mindset.</p>
<p>Systems thinking is a discipline that lends a holistic lens whilst approaching a situation. A “system” is constituted of various elements or sub-systems, which are in perennial interaction with one another leading to both intended and unintended consequences, as a result of which the system itself has emergent behaviors. We read the story of Baahubali and his village above, and we can already see some of these. Every system has a boundary, outside of which there is the environment. Hence boundaries themselves can be dynamic. What is important is not the elements per se, but the interrelationships between them, because it is the nature of the interrelationships that give character to the system. Inputs to the system are transformed within it and go out as output, which in turn informs further input with feedback.</p>
<p>A systems mindset helps us to appreciate complexity with a critical mindset considering a variety of impinging factors.</p>
<p>The development sector is faced with huge challenges and complexities. Lack of funds is just one of them, and it’s not the top one. Significant funds mobilization has been enabled through philanthropy, CSR and impact investments. But other challenges include the lack of strategic planning, efficiency in execution, poor governance, social and political interference, and the lack of integration between various initiatives operating and yet not connecting with one another. Don’t be surprised at all if there were another large company near the same village where Baahubali lives that manufactures cement and is pushing in CSR funds for better health care in the village, and yet both companies are not talking to each other!</p>
<p>Complex situations have their own characteristics. At the outset, they are difficult to pen-down, or sometimes even difficult to imagine. They start evolving as we get into them. We need to look beyond the surface and dig below what is evident to unearth what is not. Interestingly, different people can have their own narratives of the same problem. Every narrative is valid. While simple systems are often replicable and predictable, complex systems are self-organising and do not follow any given rules. Therefore, simple problems can be solved using a template that can be replicated from one situation to another. However, in case of complex problems, templatization does not work. Every problem is unique and requires unique approaches and highly situational perspectives.</p>
<p>In case of simple problems, our usual approach is to “solve” problems. In case of complex situations, we cannot just “solve” a problem, but we need to “resolve” the same. I avoid using the term “problem” and call it a “situation”. I rather ask who defines what a problem is. A situation may be called problematic by someone because of their own perspective and perspectives change from one person to another.</p>
<p>A systems interventionist approaches a situation with these aspects in mind and will essentially have three considerations. First, they will always look at boundaries critically. As for how we define boundaries is always subject to who is defining them based on their own understanding and perceptions. Consider the case above. Had Baahubali’s employer looked at drawing the boundary around sustainability and empowerment of the village, rather than just children’s education per se, they would have approached their CSR in very different manner. Second, the systems interventionist applies different methodologies and tools to approach the situation as they believe that multiple lenses will bring to the surface multiple nuances for the same situation. The company above would apply a range of tools to understand the situation and design the program that could lead to. The company above would apply a range of tools to understand the situation and design the program that could lead to the unearthing of the nuances of the village realities and address issues in a more substantial manner. The interventionist will be driven by a flexible mindset of evaluation and redesign, then just stopping a particular initiative if it did not show results. Third, a systems interventionist will always look for “betterment” of the situation – how the intervention can contribute towards the improvement of multiple stakeholders without compromising on the voices of the underprivileged. Baahubali’s employer would look for improvement of the village rather than just allocating funds for an activity. It would also institutionalise metrics that would look for holistic measurements and success parameters rather than tracking how many children are being educated year-on-year.</p>
<p>Systems thinking has inspired several methodologies over the years. These methodologies are handy for development workers through the life stages of design, implementation and measurement of interventions. Work in the development sector can be greatly benefitted by bringing into the fold approaches and methodologies inspired by systems thinking.</p>
<p>The next piece will talk about some of the approaches and methodologies that can be adopted for development projects and CSR.</p>

<h4 class="big_article_summary"><strong><i>A startup that does not understand its ecosystem players and their impact could well be caught on the wrong foot by making crucial business decisions with incomplete information.</i></strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The environment that a startup today operates in is dynamic and intertwined with various dimensions &#8211; social, economic and political &#8211; resulting in a complex web of realities. Understanding the environment leads us to appreciate market realities. Appreciation of market realities leads us to arrive at insights to navigate through it better. In the social environment, startups need to understand stakeholder behavior, demographic and psychographic. Similarly in the economic environment, macroeconomic and microeconomic factors and market externalities need to be appreciated. Finally, in the political environment, sectoral policy, startup business support and government schemes need to be understood and leveraged for success of the organization.</p>
<p>A startup that does not understand its ecosystem players and their impact could well be caught on the wrong foot by making crucial business decisions with incomplete information. The marketplace is rapidly becoming a global one, which means the geopolitical landscape that a company has to keep tabs on has expanded exponentially. A marketplace with fading borders means that that local economies are susceptible to the butterfly effect where relatively small events in one area can result in large effects in faraway places; political or financial events in other countries or regions could result in disturbances to the local ecosystem that may not be immediately obvious but could affect the startup in unanticipated ways.</p>
<p>For instance, whilst there was a phase of propaganda against Chinese goods during the festive Diwali season of 2016, it cannot be ignored that some of the biggest startups in India are funded by Chinese funds. Didi Chuxing, the company that bested Uber in China, has invested in Indian cab service company Ola and Chinese internet giant Tencent has invested heavily in in the Indian messenger app Hike as well as healthcare company Practo. Indian companies have been acquired by Chinese companies as well. This is an example where we see the social, economic and political environments inextricably interlinked.</p>
<p>The market realities we exist in today are constantly evolving and are becoming increasingly unpredictable. In such an environment, it is important for organizations to be agile and resilient in how they respond and react to their external environments.</p>
<p>As we navigate through these dynamic market realities, what has stayed constant over the last multiple decades is the importance of a company to create and sustain a reputation that fosters a positive relationship with all its stakeholders. Embracing a holistic approach to public relations encompassing aspects to touch stakeholders beyond pure media vehicle is most important.</p>
<p>Startups, especially as they incubate, tend to narrow-focus on building their product or service, but it is important to stay aware of their ecosystem and market dynamics that affect them. They may mistakenly assume that public relations building and stakeholder engagement can come later “when they are successful”. There have been examples of startups that had an exciting initial trajectory but were soon derailed because they did not understand the importance of reputation in their stakeholders’ view; one startup had its in-fighting made public in an ugly manner and another had to deal with a founder being accused of insider trading. The last two years have also seen a tepid momentum in the startup ecosystem in the country with mounting losses for some of the largest e-commerce players due to overspending on marketing, advertising and discounting. At the close of the year-2016, The Financial Express reported e-commerce companies in India like Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm contributing for 70% of the total loss of INR 10,670 crore that the industry has been hit with. This has led to decreased investor and analyst confidence leading to the long term damage of several known companies in their expansion and stabilization phases. The important takeaway is the focus that needs to be directed to get the fundamentals of sustainable business in place before over-focusing on external branding and communication; hence the need to work diligently on building long-term reputation rather than a short-term image.</p>
<p>While these companies may eventually recover from the hits they took, an awareness of the importance of public relations and strategic communications, pillared on firming their reputation, would have helped avoid or at least mitigate the negativity.</p>
<p>The success startups seek is hinged on this very relationship with the stakeholders — including investors, prospective employees, communities, agencies, analysts and customers — which in turn builds goodwill with the publics.</p>
<p>Only a robust stakeholder engagement strategy can support startups navigate towards building successful institutions in the twenty first century market realities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grand Bazaar, or Al-Madina Souk of Istanbul, is one of the world’s oldest, most crowded, difficult to navigate, claustrophobic marketplaces.</p>
<p>Narrow alleys, 4500 plus shops, with 2,500 plus connecting rooms, a mosque, 19 fountains, several squares, 18 gates, shopkeepers, street sellers of different services, con-artists, and anything between 250,000 to 400,000 visitors, every single day!</p>
<p>It goes without saying that few people come here to buy anything in particular.</p>
<p>Why then, do 91,250,000 odd tourists flock here every year?</p>
<p>Well, they come here for the ‘experience’.</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve clothed experience in different garbs and watched it through different lenses. While all along, time and again, experience has been calling out for recognition.</p>
<p>Finally, the layers of the glass onion have peeled, and time has come to raise a toast to the value of a great experience.</p>
<p><strong>Experience – a 21<sup>st</sup> century market reality</strong></p>
<p>The 21<sup>st</sup> century market environment is much like the Al-Madina Souk. Visitors here include Flower Children, Baby Boomers, GenX, Millennials and the iGen. It is a market that believes it is entitled to great experiences. It also is a market which doesn’t make room for second chances.</p>
<p>This market is fuelled by technology. The close bond between customer experience and technology is one of the key realities of this digitally connected space, where you are just-one-click-away-from-your-heart’s-desire.</p>
<p>So, here’s a look at some rules that will determine whether you navigate this market, or get lost forever.</p>
<p>&#8211; Technology is the strategic asset that will enable a fluid engagement between people, processes and products.</p>
<p>&#8211; Technology cannot be ‘a’ department in your company. It must be the fuel of every department.</p>
<p>&#8211; Experience drives engagement and determines loyalty.</p>
<p>&#8211; Your vision must be to deliver a complete and positive customer experience.</p>
<p>&#8211; Multiple devices are today’s order.</p>
<p>&#8211;  Multiple experiences through a single device tops in the race for space</p>
<p>&#8211; Experiences must be delivered across devices and geared to lean towards hand-held, anytime, anywhere devices.</p>
<p>Almost on every count, experience rules the roost. Let’s face it, folks &#8211; experience has always called the shots. It always will.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2016 has been an interesting year to say the least and, if nothing else, it has really brought the whole issue of globalization into very sharp focus. Fittingly, the <u><a href="http://the-practice.net/category/viewpoint" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">October issue</a></u> of The PRactice’s publication, Viewpoint, was also about this theme and gave us a lot to mull over.</p>
<p>I particularly liked how one <u><a href="http://the-practice.net/globalisation-101.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">contributor</a></u>, Ramu Damodaran of the UN, summed up the populist pushback to globalization: “The one factor to keep in mind is that, historically, whenever human beings have sought to create larger political or social entities, there has always been opposition in one form or another. That has definitely been true in the history of India – through periods spanning the growth of the British empire as well as various wars or conflicts that predate it – and it is something we are experiencing again now…”</p>
<p>There are probably some real reasons driving the resistance, Damodaran went on to add:</p>
<p>“While, on the face of it, much of this assertion of identity is cloaked in nationalistic or communal terms, the real imperative may well be economic.”</p>
<p>We have seen plenty of evidence of this in 2016 – in the unexpected and almost shocking outcomes of the Brexit vote and the US elections. These outcomes came layered with overtones of bigotry and xenophobia until we dug a little deeper to find large-scale disillusionment among people in economically sidelined regions.</p>
<p>So, globalization is not always an equitable system. But is it possible to roll it back? And will that help the global economy? Lastly, if there is historical precedent to all of this, then shouldn’t we be looking to history for answers?</p>
<p>That is what Ruchir Sharma (Chief Global Strategist at Morgan Stanley) has attempted to do in this eye-opening <u><a href="http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/1914-revisited-open-world-order-is-breaking-apart-likely-fallout-of-globalisations-retreat-is-slower-growth-higher-inflation-and-rising-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog</a></u> for the TOI. I found it a terrific read because it so nicely tied together the circumstances that led to deglobalization in in the decades following World War I to what we are currently experiencing.</p>
<p>I would recommend this article to anyone aiming for a better historical perspective on the situation. In essence, Sharma compares the retreat from globalization in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, to a similar withdrawal around the time that World War I broke out. A comparable wave of rising populist and anti-immigrant sentiment at the time led to a slew of protectionist and inward looking measures in the US. In the long run, these and other measures only helped to deepen the recession in that country and promote the rise of autocracies in other nations that ultimately set the stage for World War II.</p>
<p>2008 was a similar turning point in the economic history of the world and if what Sharma says is true then we have to brace ourselves for a prolonged period of deglobalization that is likely to be marked by ‘slower growth, higher inflation and rising conflict’.</p>
<p>Globalists may dismiss recent events as just road bumps in the journey but Sharma points to another trend that indicates a real rollback – namely, a significant slowdown in the flow of trade, capital and people across borders in recent times. The situation definitely throws up a lot of questions that don’t have easy answers. How will Trump’s trade policies play out in the next four years? What does it mean for countries whose economies depend on global commerce? Will India with its robust domestic market be OK?</p>
<p>Ruchir Sharma has gone on to elaborate on his model for picking economic winners and losers in a book titled ‘The Rise and Fall of Nations’. I am adding that to my ‘to read’ list.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United Way Bengaluru (UWBe), one of Bangalore&#8217;s leading non-profit organisations, wanted to organise a unique event to bring together the most important stakeholders of the city &#8211; its denizens. The organisation chose the picturesque Nandi Hills as the locale and The PRactice took on the challenge of organising a first-of-its-kind Hillathon where participants would run a verdant and hilly course to raise funds for a local cause of their choice.</p>
<p>The team had less than a month to bring this fund -”racing” event to life.  Participants could choose the course &#8211; a 6 km Heritage walk or an endurance-challenging half marathon. It was decided that the funds raised from the event will go to different charitable cause selected by participants and not by the organiser.</p>
<p>Under the team’s creative onslaught, the Nandi Hillathon campaign began to take shape. The PRactice team doubled up to work with media channels, both local and national, to garner the widest possible exposure for this citizen initiative. In addition to highlighting the event itself, the media stories focused on local causes, participation of transgenders, and citizen champions in the Hillathon. Local celebrities were enlisted and their familiar presence was leveraged to spread awareness about the event and its mission. The event was listed on Milaap, India’s leading crowdfunding site for social causes, as well as every other city-specific event listings. Meanwhile, creative use of engaging videos, contest campaigns and hashtags were used to create buzz on social media.</p>
<p>The team also undertook a sustained influencer outreach and connected with Bengaluru-based running, fitness and hiking  groups, as well as groups focused on supporting local activities in the city. The team reached out to Corporates, NGOs and Resident Welfare Associations (RWA) to underscore Nandi Hillathon&#8217;s mission to address issues that are dear to most Bengalurians, like restoring biodiversity to Nandi Hills and cleaning up the badly polluted  lakes in the city.</p>
<p>All the hard work and resourcefulness paid off!</p>
<p>The event was a resounding success with over 600 participants. It received 64 stories including 6 in regional television coverage. A leading publication carried a detailed print story about the event and its mission. Curated interactions with leaders of the transgender community resulted in 2 high impact feature stories. The digital outreach on social media [organic and paid] resulted in nearly 200,000 impressions.</p>
<p>The UWBe team was extremely impressed and appreciative of The PRactice&#8217;s contributions.</p>
<p><strong><em> “We were lucky to partner with The PRactice.The team was a delight to work with! There were no dearth of ideas and action from their side&#8230; The team understood us completely and despite the less than 35 day deadline, did an amazing job. We loved the professionalism displayed by the team and their execution efficiency at each stage. We are glad that this partnership worked and look forward to having them on board for our various projects.”</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Nicorette, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, is a world leader in therapeutic pharmaceutical products to help smokers quit their destructive habit. The company wanted to build awareness about their products with special emphasis on their safety and efficacy, and they turned to The PRactice to help establish Nicorette as a trustworthy partner in the “Quit Smoking” journey.</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The PRactice team launched an aggressive media outreach campaign to draw focus to the state of smoking in India and how smokers who understand its perils can use Nicorette products to help them kick their addiction. The campaign included press releases describing the launch of new products as well as one-on-one interviews with key publications. Consumer research and survey data about consumer psyche and the behavioural patterns of smokers and those trying to quit was used in interactions with key opinion leaders across India to create a convincing case about the importance of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) in a smoking cessation program.</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The extensive media coverage in print, broadcast and online channels featured Nicorette as a trusted partner in what can be a difficult journey and created awareness about the company’s NRT products. The success of the campaign was immediately obvious; 155 press clips were carried in Tier 1 publications and soon after the retail stock of Nicorette products was exhausted. Furthermore, the campaign helped strengthen brand equity thanks to 41% of the stories featuring the Nicorette brand name in the headline, and 50% of all stories carrying the Johnson &amp; Johnson brand name in the headline.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent Hurun India Philanthropy List 2015 reported Azim Premji as the most generous Indian, donating INR 27,514 crore (USD 4200 million) on education initiatives, through the Azim Premji Foundation.</p>
<p>The same report also listed individuals like Nandan and Rohini Nilekani, NR Narayana Murthy, K Dinesh and family, Shiv Nadar, Sunny Varkey and family, Ronnie Screwvala, Rahul Bajaj and family, and Pallonji Mistry as the top 10 philanthropists in India, alongside Premji.</p>
<p>These individuals have diverted immense personal wealth to causes that they intensely believe in, that range from education to health, urban governance to social development, facilitating livelihoods to creating empowerment.</p>
<p>These corporate leaders have shown the way in giving for social causes from their personal wealth. In a way, they have given a stimulus for philanthropy to grow in India, and lead the way towards creating a more equitable and just society.</p>
<p>The nation is in the process of accelerating the implementation of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) regulations under the new Companies Act. The Act not only makes contributions by large profitable companies mandatory but is also likely to improve the governance of the non-profit space by stipulating programmatic donations from corporations and oversight from their CSR boards. CSR is now a legal requirement and is mandatory for companies that make profit. Donations under CSR are linked to the company’s strategy.</p>
<p>However, individual philanthropy is neither a legal requirement nor mandatory. It is something that emerges from the heart. Therefore, it has much more personal value than CSR and connects the donor emotionally to the citizenry. The new Companies Act will also trigger a positive disruption in the philanthropy space, bringing in more corporate donors and creating greater accountability and transparency.</p>
<p>While CSR is important for non-profit organizations engaged in social work to build a strong corpus for the long run, individual philanthropy is required to spread the concept of giving horizontally to cover more segments of society. So any developing society needs both CSR and individual philanthropy to work in collectively and yet complement each other.</p>
<p>Business families that have been giving for philanthropy for generations have well-entrenched processes to facilitate this. But it is gratifying to find that more and more individuals in India are now opening their purse strings. Many of them are first-time philanthropists in their families. However, individuals often find themselves at a loss when picking a cause or following through with significant engagement, in terms of both time and money. This can be addressed by making the receiving organizations more structured with higher transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Historically, giving in India has been largely family endowments to institutions. But in recent years, individuals and professionals are getting together to seed and fund initiatives in a collaborative manner. Individuals are feeling more comfortable sharing their experiences and helping each other to scale up and measure the impact of their philanthropy. An example of this is, Sudarshan Jain and his wife Vanmala, First Giver’s Club (FCG) members of non-profit organization Give India, have been doing. They run a vocational training centre in Mumbai for school dropouts and women. They have also obtained a certification for their products and endorsements from agencies on the social impact their project creates.</p>
<p>But are we giving enough? A recent report by Bain Consulting reveals that on an average, Indian HNIs are giving 2-3 percent of their income. This is way below American HNIs, who give 8-11 percent of their income to charity. So there is scope for much more.</p>
<p>In 1999, Dell founder Michael Dell and his wife Susan established the Michael &amp; Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. The foundation has provided $65 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas. By 2010, the foundation had committed more than USD 650 million to children’s issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa. In 2012, the Foundation committed $50 million for medical education and in 2014, it donated USD 1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defence Forces.</p>
<p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, launched in 2000 by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, is said to be the largest transparently operated private foundation in the world. The primary aims of the foundation are, globally, to enhance healthcare and reduce extreme poverty, and in America, to expand educational opportunities and access to information technology. The Foundation had an endowment of USD 44.3 billion at the end of 2014. The scale of the foundation and the way it seeks to apply business techniques to giving makes it one of the leaders in venture philanthropy.</p>
<p>In comparison, philanthropy by foundations in India is still at a nascent stage. While a good beginning has been made, the process has to be much more structured to make it sustainable over a long period as in the US.</p>
<p>But there is a silver lining. According to “Indian Philanthropy Report 2015” by Bain &amp; Company, in 2009, only 14% of the adult population across India donated cash and some 12% donated their time. In 2013, 28% of the adult population donated money and 21% donated their time. This meant a staggering increase of more than 100 million more Indians making donations in cash or time than in 2009. A strong economy, growing wealth and greater global interest in India have underpinned this growth in the philanthropic activity of individuals and corporations.</p>
<p>A case in point is Swades Foundation started by media baron Ronnie Screwvala and his wife Zarina. The Foundation operates with the single-minded focus of empowering rural India. It believes that the partnership of rural India with corporates, young urban India, the Government and other foundations is the key to create a permanent and irreversible change for good. For this, the Foundation has created a model of sustainable development, which is a benchmark in the industry and can be replicated on a large scale. Swades’ mission is to empower 1 million rural Indians every five years, creating a permanent, irreversible change for good.</p>
<p>Sampark Foundation, started by former HCL Technologies CEO Vineet Nayar, has been consistently working on improving education, climate, livelihood and entrepreneurship in the rural areas.</p>
<p>The philanthropic work of foundations belonging to TATA and the Birlas, are of course, legion.</p>
<p>But the major bottleneck, still, is the difficulty in finding credible non-profit organisations. The bulk of the non-profit sector is trapped pursuing a large number of disconnected donors. As a result, philanthropy in India has become two-tiered. Sophisticated donors are choosing to work with a small number of highly credible non-profit organisations. Disconnected donors and unsophisticated non-profits are trapped in an unending and unproductive pursuit of new causes and new funders respectively.</p>
<p>Non-profit organizations should not only motivate people to give, but also create awareness by showcasing the philanthropy of their donors. We need to create an ocean of givers. More and more Indians need to realize that nothing can be more satisfying in life than giving.</p>
