				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amadeus Labs, a global IT solutions provider for the travel industry, faced the challenge of attracting and retaining the best engineering talent in the country due to fierce competition from established IT brands in India, including Google, Microsoft, Facebook etc. The ask therefore was to build a strong brand equity among the leading engineering institutes and among senior executives in India to spotlight the pro-employee work culture.  We had to articulate this message through compelling communication strategies that resonate with the target audience on relevant platforms.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Thirty initiatives around employee engagement were executed in 24 months including a POSH (prevention of sexual harassment) program; a monthly newsletter Disruption Chronicles, The aGeek series, and others.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the outset, we studied the technology and employee landscape and accordingly ideated activities that resulted in maximum engagement. Subsequently, The PRactice rolled out a comprehensive </span><b>Stakeholder Engagement program  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">encompassing approaches to reach key stakeholders via content and design elements. The messaging pertained to employee benefits, engagement initiatives, rewards and recognition, workplace diversity etc.  Thirty initiatives around employee engagement were executed in 24 months including a POSH (prevention of sexual harassment) program; a monthly newsletter Disruption Chronicles, The aGeek series, and others.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A robust </span><b>Communication Design program,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interspersed with video and animation, especially on their 26 weeks Maternity Leave Policy conveyed through two curated mailers with graphics caught the attention of the employees. The outcome: the employee strength doubled to 1,800 at Amadeus Labs.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, even the largest corporates develop tunnel vision. Often, this prevents them from seeing the writing on the wall, leading to situations that may spiral out of control.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infosys Technologies was facing its first ever media crisis in 2004. With an organization restructuring underway, the Company had to face disgruntled employees.  As their Public Relations partners who were closely monitoring employee sentiments, The PRactice had sensed the beginnings of the turbulence and through an extensive researched document advised the client of the impending dangers. This was however, initially ignored.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the media got wind of the internal turmoil, they raised a hue and cry. The once accessible Infosys built a wall around itself and stayed inaccessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True to our commitment of having the client’s best interest at heart, The PRactice argued with senior management and took the issue to the very helm. The leadership team was surprised that our advice had previously gone unheeded and sent out a mandate that The PRactice would have direct access to the leadership.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereafter, together we worked on strong messaging to combat the negative press. Infosys came out of its shell to interact with the media more than before, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping communication lines open at all times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on this case study, The PRactice often advises clients to re-prioritize communications efforts and to put internal communication ahead of media relations.  We work on a stakeholder relationship mapping which shows clients that the morale of employees has a direct impact on the image of the company in good times and when the going gets tough.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The R&amp;D unit of Microsoft, MSIDC, was having trouble hiring top notch talent in 2006. The key stakeholders (talent and media representatives) had minimal knowledge of the kind of work done at the centre. The PRactice was called in to build better recall for the business unit’s core capabilities in product development and attract talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main objective of the campaign was to establish the centre as a critical component of Microsoft’s growth. By positioning the centre as a thought leader and a key driver of software product development in India, The PRactice was able to showcase how invaluable the division was to Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several corporate and HR campaigns were conducted in the form of media interactions, technology briefings, stakeholder relationship meetings and events. This helped in constantly feeding the knowledge pool with industry trends and also establishing the centre as an employee-centric organization by showcasing its pro-employee policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive visits from global Microsoft leaders helped, as did key product launches for Microsoft. At the end of the campaign, the unit was considered a thought leader, innovator and a key driver of software product development at Microsoft. The centre also became one of the most desired R&amp;D centres in India to work at.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<h4 class="big_article_summary"><strong><i>A startup that does not understand its ecosystem players and their impact could well be caught on the wrong foot by making crucial business decisions with incomplete information.</i></strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The environment that a startup today operates in is dynamic and intertwined with various dimensions &#8211; social, economic and political &#8211; resulting in a complex web of realities. Understanding the environment leads us to appreciate market realities. Appreciation of market realities leads us to arrive at insights to navigate through it better. In the social environment, startups need to understand stakeholder behavior, demographic and psychographic. Similarly in the economic environment, macroeconomic and microeconomic factors and market externalities need to be appreciated. Finally, in the political environment, sectoral policy, startup business support and government schemes need to be understood and leveraged for success of the organization.</p>
<p>A startup that does not understand its ecosystem players and their impact could well be caught on the wrong foot by making crucial business decisions with incomplete information. The marketplace is rapidly becoming a global one, which means the geopolitical landscape that a company has to keep tabs on has expanded exponentially. A marketplace with fading borders means that that local economies are susceptible to the butterfly effect where relatively small events in one area can result in large effects in faraway places; political or financial events in other countries or regions could result in disturbances to the local ecosystem that may not be immediately obvious but could affect the startup in unanticipated ways.</p>
<p>For instance, whilst there was a phase of propaganda against Chinese goods during the festive Diwali season of 2016, it cannot be ignored that some of the biggest startups in India are funded by Chinese funds. Didi Chuxing, the company that bested Uber in China, has invested in Indian cab service company Ola and Chinese internet giant Tencent has invested heavily in in the Indian messenger app Hike as well as healthcare company Practo. Indian companies have been acquired by Chinese companies as well. This is an example where we see the social, economic and political environments inextricably interlinked.</p>
<p>The market realities we exist in today are constantly evolving and are becoming increasingly unpredictable. In such an environment, it is important for organizations to be agile and resilient in how they respond and react to their external environments.</p>
<p>As we navigate through these dynamic market realities, what has stayed constant over the last multiple decades is the importance of a company to create and sustain a reputation that fosters a positive relationship with all its stakeholders. Embracing a holistic approach to public relations encompassing aspects to touch stakeholders beyond pure media vehicle is most important.</p>
<p>Startups, especially as they incubate, tend to narrow-focus on building their product or service, but it is important to stay aware of their ecosystem and market dynamics that affect them. They may mistakenly assume that public relations building and stakeholder engagement can come later “when they are successful”. There have been examples of startups that had an exciting initial trajectory but were soon derailed because they did not understand the importance of reputation in their stakeholders’ view; one startup had its in-fighting made public in an ugly manner and another had to deal with a founder being accused of insider trading. The last two years have also seen a tepid momentum in the startup ecosystem in the country with mounting losses for some of the largest e-commerce players due to overspending on marketing, advertising and discounting. At the close of the year-2016, The Financial Express reported e-commerce companies in India like Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm contributing for 70% of the total loss of INR 10,670 crore that the industry has been hit with. This has led to decreased investor and analyst confidence leading to the long term damage of several known companies in their expansion and stabilization phases. The important takeaway is the focus that needs to be directed to get the fundamentals of sustainable business in place before over-focusing on external branding and communication; hence the need to work diligently on building long-term reputation rather than a short-term image.</p>
<p>While these companies may eventually recover from the hits they took, an awareness of the importance of public relations and strategic communications, pillared on firming their reputation, would have helped avoid or at least mitigate the negativity.</p>
<p>The success startups seek is hinged on this very relationship with the stakeholders — including investors, prospective employees, communities, agencies, analysts and customers — which in turn builds goodwill with the publics.</p>
<p>Only a robust stakeholder engagement strategy can support startups navigate towards building successful institutions in the twenty first century market realities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grand Bazaar, or Al-Madina Souk of Istanbul, is one of the world’s oldest, most crowded, difficult to navigate, claustrophobic marketplaces.</p>
<p>Narrow alleys, 4500 plus shops, with 2,500 plus connecting rooms, a mosque, 19 fountains, several squares, 18 gates, shopkeepers, street sellers of different services, con-artists, and anything between 250,000 to 400,000 visitors, every single day!</p>
<p>It goes without saying that few people come here to buy anything in particular.</p>
<p>Why then, do 91,250,000 odd tourists flock here every year?</p>
<p>Well, they come here for the ‘experience’.</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve clothed experience in different garbs and watched it through different lenses. While all along, time and again, experience has been calling out for recognition.</p>
<p>Finally, the layers of the glass onion have peeled, and time has come to raise a toast to the value of a great experience.</p>
<p><strong>Experience – a 21<sup>st</sup> century market reality</strong></p>
<p>The 21<sup>st</sup> century market environment is much like the Al-Madina Souk. Visitors here include Flower Children, Baby Boomers, GenX, Millennials and the iGen. It is a market that believes it is entitled to great experiences. It also is a market which doesn’t make room for second chances.</p>
<p>This market is fuelled by technology. The close bond between customer experience and technology is one of the key realities of this digitally connected space, where you are just-one-click-away-from-your-heart’s-desire.</p>
<p>So, here’s a look at some rules that will determine whether you navigate this market, or get lost forever.</p>
<p>&#8211; Technology is the strategic asset that will enable a fluid engagement between people, processes and products.</p>
<p>&#8211; Technology cannot be ‘a’ department in your company. It must be the fuel of every department.</p>
<p>&#8211; Experience drives engagement and determines loyalty.</p>
<p>&#8211; Your vision must be to deliver a complete and positive customer experience.</p>
<p>&#8211; Multiple devices are today’s order.</p>
<p>&#8211;  Multiple experiences through a single device tops in the race for space</p>
<p>&#8211; Experiences must be delivered across devices and geared to lean towards hand-held, anytime, anywhere devices.</p>
<p>Almost on every count, experience rules the roost. Let’s face it, folks &#8211; experience has always called the shots. It always will.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://the-practice.net/creativity-101-takes.html/1-4" rel="attachment wp-att-3339"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3339 size-full" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1.png" width="572" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>Design is more than just making something look pretty or aesthetically pleasing. When creating collaterals or internal communication mailers, it’s important to meet the client, capture a brief accurately and re-lay the same information to your content and design team.</p>
<p>Creatives are usually based on the content; the content needs to be focused on the key message. It has to have a theme and more importantly re-lay the right information to the target audience. A creative has to have the right tone, colour, icon, look and feel. When thinking about the content and design of the collateral, one needs to keep in mind the three brackets the collateral will fall under: Inform, Engage, or Inspire.</p>
<p>When you tie all these elements together, that’s when you create something spectacular. It’s definitely not an easy task, but it’s something we strive to do at The PRactice daily. We challenge ourselves to think out-of-the-box, use trends, tactics and strategy when developing collaterals for Internal Communications.</p>
<p>So here is how we went about doing an exciting piece of work for Amadeus Labs.</p>
<p>Amadeus Labs, the second largest R&amp;D site for Amadeus IT Group, an IT solutions provider for the global travel industry wanted us to help them with the roll out of the new ‘Maternity Leave’ policy of 26 weeks to all expecting mothers in the organisation.</p>
<p>We decided to convey this policy through two interesting mailers that instantly caught the employees attention. The mailers were to be graphical and convey that Amadeus Labs is one of the first companies to roll out this initiative.</p>
<p>The first mailer was to be a teaser &#8211; A captivating headline was crafted to grab the attention.</p>
<p><a href="http://the-practice.net/creativity-101-takes.html/2-4" rel="attachment wp-att-3340"><img class="wp-image-3340 size-full aligncenter" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2.jpg" width="369" height="550" /></a><br />
Few days after sending out the first mailer we shared the second one. We connected it back to the ‘great news’ in the teaser, and hit the message of being one of the ‘first’ companies to roll out this policy.</p>
<p><a href="http://the-practice.net/creativity-101-takes.html/3-2" rel="attachment wp-att-3341"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3341 size-full" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3-e1484635624226.png" width="467" height="563" /></a></p>
<p>The mailers were a great success and the employees were happy to receive &#8220;the good news&#8221;.</p>
<p>“Amadeus Labs has been working with The PRactice for close to two years now. The engagement began in early 2015 with a need for a Public Relationship exercise to leverage on a senior leadership visit in Bangalore. Soon, the scope of work expanded to cover aspects like employer branding and internal communications. I am very happy with the team that is responsible for the Amadeus account. Be it client servicing or creative, the team has been able to understand the business and communication needs and have successfully delivered some fantastic results for high impact campaigns&#8221;.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2016 has been an interesting year to say the least and, if nothing else, it has really brought the whole issue of globalization into very sharp focus. Fittingly, the <u><a href="http://the-practice.net/category/viewpoint" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">October issue</a></u> of The PRactice’s publication, Viewpoint, was also about this theme and gave us a lot to mull over.</p>
<p>I particularly liked how one <u><a href="http://the-practice.net/globalisation-101.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">contributor</a></u>, Ramu Damodaran of the UN, summed up the populist pushback to globalization: “The one factor to keep in mind is that, historically, whenever human beings have sought to create larger political or social entities, there has always been opposition in one form or another. That has definitely been true in the history of India – through periods spanning the growth of the British empire as well as various wars or conflicts that predate it – and it is something we are experiencing again now…”</p>
<p>There are probably some real reasons driving the resistance, Damodaran went on to add:</p>
<p>“While, on the face of it, much of this assertion of identity is cloaked in nationalistic or communal terms, the real imperative may well be economic.”</p>
<p>We have seen plenty of evidence of this in 2016 – in the unexpected and almost shocking outcomes of the Brexit vote and the US elections. These outcomes came layered with overtones of bigotry and xenophobia until we dug a little deeper to find large-scale disillusionment among people in economically sidelined regions.</p>
<p>So, globalization is not always an equitable system. But is it possible to roll it back? And will that help the global economy? Lastly, if there is historical precedent to all of this, then shouldn’t we be looking to history for answers?</p>
<p>That is what Ruchir Sharma (Chief Global Strategist at Morgan Stanley) has attempted to do in this eye-opening <u><a href="http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/1914-revisited-open-world-order-is-breaking-apart-likely-fallout-of-globalisations-retreat-is-slower-growth-higher-inflation-and-rising-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog</a></u> for the TOI. I found it a terrific read because it so nicely tied together the circumstances that led to deglobalization in in the decades following World War I to what we are currently experiencing.</p>
<p>I would recommend this article to anyone aiming for a better historical perspective on the situation. In essence, Sharma compares the retreat from globalization in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, to a similar withdrawal around the time that World War I broke out. A comparable wave of rising populist and anti-immigrant sentiment at the time led to a slew of protectionist and inward looking measures in the US. In the long run, these and other measures only helped to deepen the recession in that country and promote the rise of autocracies in other nations that ultimately set the stage for World War II.</p>
<p>2008 was a similar turning point in the economic history of the world and if what Sharma says is true then we have to brace ourselves for a prolonged period of deglobalization that is likely to be marked by ‘slower growth, higher inflation and rising conflict’.</p>
<p>Globalists may dismiss recent events as just road bumps in the journey but Sharma points to another trend that indicates a real rollback – namely, a significant slowdown in the flow of trade, capital and people across borders in recent times. The situation definitely throws up a lot of questions that don’t have easy answers. How will Trump’s trade policies play out in the next four years? What does it mean for countries whose economies depend on global commerce? Will India with its robust domestic market be OK?</p>
<p>Ruchir Sharma has gone on to elaborate on his model for picking economic winners and losers in a book titled ‘The Rise and Fall of Nations’. I am adding that to my ‘to read’ list.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are witnessing a continual transformation in the way organisations are being shaped by an ever dynamic and evolving workforce – employee expectations seen as never before, highly informed and networked professionals, and Gen-Y demanding a new character for work itself.</p>
<p>This transformation demands a shift in mindset and focus for communications professionals if they want to be relevant in this environment. Internal communications is an area that not only needs a refocus, but also a rethink.</p>
<p>In the current eco-system, extraordinary content is being generated by employees themselves. Control over content is probably moving away from communications professionals to employees. With employee blogs, social media platforms, LinkedIn, and employment experience sharing portals like Glassdoor and Jobeehive, today’s workforce does not have to look for content outside itself.</p>
<p>The traditional role of an internal communications professional to create and disseminate content is gradually changing to be that of a mindful facilitator of what is being created by people and how this in turn is shaping the organisations character. It is in this light that Mike Grafham from <a href="https://yammer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yammer</a> suggests that the role of an internal communicator needs to change “from creator to curator”.</p>
<p>Communications professionals will need an increasingly integrated approach that not only harmonizes communication within the organisational system, but also aligns the same to the strategic vision of the firm.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="http://intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intuit</a>, an American technology firm that has its own facilities to create and broadcast videos through Intuit-TV – a channel that spreads internal messages to its people; this platform also carries the feature of two-way communication where employees can post videos and have interactions. A recent upgrade makes the videos embeddable to any web-page within the company’s intranet. This complements the ever evolving presence of the firm in its employee Facebook page.</p>
<div>
<p>In addition, Intuit boasts its own in-house innovation catalyst tool, “Design for Delight”, that facilitates employees to experiment with new ideas. These approaches enable employees at Intuit to realise the firm’s promise as a great place to innovate.</p>
<p>With emerging trends like activity streaming and gamification already penetrating the workplace, the future will probably see the function of internal communications graduate from designing and channeling communication to being facilitators of content and influencers for impact.</p>
<p>Communication strategies can yield desirable results only when they are customised, and to a large extent personalised for the specific context. If modern technology has proven magic for a certain firm, the secret of success for another could have been borrowed from highly “native” approaches.</p>
<p>Often under-leveraged, storytelling has been the most powerful communication tool used by aboriginal tribes to pass on knowledge across generations. In today’s organisations that are separated by geography and connected by networks, powerful and personal employee storytelling can be effectively used to create consistent organisational value systems.</p>
<p><a href="http://kempinski.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kempinski</a>, the European luxury hotel group, undertook an exciting initiative to embrace its diverse workforce across continents into its organisational DNA through this approach, where employees of different functions, levels and countries shared experiences of their everyday life and unique anecdotes that enable them to live the Kempinski DNA – a brilliant example where employees were themselves the content creators. A comprehensive exercise using this approach enables geographically diverse and separated teams to live the Kempinski values through the mutual sharing of stories.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of focus it demands, internal communications needs to be driven by human resources and corporate communications in collaboration. Human resources needs to appreciate what the organisation and its people want, and corporate communications needs to facilitate the same as enabling agents. This needs to be pillared on an alignment with business; there is no cookie-cutter approach.</p>
<p>Designing a robust business-aligned internal communications approach involves comprehensive appreciation of stakeholders, identifying key messages, developing a focused strategy, monitoring emergent patterns and building internal capability. A similar approach aptly demonstrated by <a href="http://ericsson.com/in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ericsson</a> had led to the role of internal communications evolving from a “news flow” to a “supporting leadership” function within the company.</p>
<div>
<p>With the new realities faced by organisations, communications professionals will need to rethink. A recent report by Aon Hewitt suggests that globally less than half (49%) of employees think that their company communicates effectively, at times even on the basics. Three important takeaways get highlighted in this note for effective internal communications – integration, customisation and alignment.</p>
<p>If approached intelligently, internal communications can fuel employee engagement, and employee engagement can in turn drive business performance. A rethink on internal communications under the new realities will only redeem the relevance of the function for the future.</p>
