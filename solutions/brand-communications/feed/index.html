				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Adelaide, Kangaroo Island and Barossa in South Australia are not commonly considered as holiday destinations for Indians. Awareness of this region was amplified when Adelaide hosted the India vs Pakistan match during the ICC World Cup 2015. The challenge before The Practice was: To leverage the momentum from the World Cup match to drive more  visitors to South Australian destinations and to position the region as a destination of choice for Indian tourists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of our sustained online strategy attracted a 71 per cent increase in fans, 18X spike in organic reach and a 10X jump  in organic engagement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At first, we developed a message map, which helped us to zero in on unique offerings of five key destinations. Under our <b>Strategic Media Relations program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we drew on opportunities like the shooting of a popular Hindi TV series at Adelaide, Baross and Kangaroo Island</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to attract arrivals; and announcements of SATC investment programs in India to target trade and financial media. In two years, we had organized 11 familiarization trips for the media, which included </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Geographic Traveller </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Times Life</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our strategic brand positioning solution translated into 170 stories for our client garnering over 1.4 billion impressions and AUD 8 million in PR value. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our <b>Stakeholder Engagement program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on deploying key social media influencers in the lifestyle and cricket space to reach our target audience comprising of honeymooners, independent travellers and cricket enthusiasts. We executed three influencer campaigns over two years, which led to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">30-50k likes per post and over 400 million media impressions. The main objective of our </span><b>Digital Engagement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign was to boost engagement for each post on the official South Australia Facebook page in India.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of our sustained online strategy attracted a 71 per cent increase in fans, 18X spike in organic reach and a 10X jump  in organic engagement.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013, Altigreen is in the business of accelerating a customer’s smooth transition to  an all electric or hybrid electric vehicle through their indigenously developed full technology stack. Being a new market concept and a startup, Altigreen required a strong push to get conversations started in this space.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The client approached The PRactice in the winter of 2016, when Delhi’s dilemma with smog and rising pollution was at its peak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy was executed by driving a narrative around Altigreen’s journey as a startup and through crafted messaging on an innovative green brand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Our Strategic Media Relations program </b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">pursued an approach which capitalized on the relevancy of the brand solution in the light of heightened concerns about the environment. This strategy was executed by driving a narrative around Altigreen’s journey as a startup and through crafted messaging on an innovative green brand. This messaging had to resonate with all the stakeholders in the space. We were able to galvanise interest about the category and the brand in the media leading to a successful outcome:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a matter of six months, the PRactice had generated successful high impact stories in 18 Tier 1 mainline publications and electronic media such as ET, CNBC, TV 18, HBO etc. Efforts are now on to establish a thought leadership positioning for the brand in the extremely relevant yet less explored landscape of green mobility.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The objective of the Second Bihar Innovation Forum was to achieve social &amp; economic empowerment of the rural poor in Bihar. In 2013, the client wanted to drive a communication campaign that would reach out to impactful social innovators from public, private and civil society organizations registered in India, and invite them to participate in the Second Bihar Innovation Forum (BIF2).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">BIF2 had identified eight livelihood themes &#8211; Agriculture, livestock, financial services, rural energy, ICT based solution, skill development &amp; non-farm sector, access to public entitlements and access to services.  Participants were to come up with income generating solutions, within these themes. These solutions aimed to provide the rural folk of Bihar with a reason to stay on in the state and prevent migration to towns and cities, where they go to seek a livelihood.</p>
<blockquote><p>The campaign drew desired media visibility and a rush of activity on the website.  As an outcome, around 500 innovators submitted their applications for the Second Bihar Innovation Forum.</p></blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice designed a communication program that showcased the potential of the state and educated high impact investors about the support from the government and World Bank. We wanted to convince innovators to roll out their businesses in Bihar and create livelihood opportunities for its residents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign drew desired media visibility and a rush of activity on the website.  As an outcome, around 500 innovators submitted their applications for the Second Bihar Innovation Forum. It was indeed a resounding success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Instamojo is India’s first full-stack transactional platform for MSMEs. A blend of technology, data, design and ‘little bit of Mojo’, Instamojo makes it possible for small entrepreneurs from tier 2 and tier 3 towns to start an online store, and easily accept payments with just a mere link. In spite of being the pioneer of on-demand payments in India, Instamojo, faced a challenge due to the lack of differentiation among the media, between payment gateways and on-demand payments. Furthermore, the company had low awareness and recall among its stakeholders when compared to players such as PayPal and RazorPay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice got onboard and recommended a <b>Strategic Media Relations  </b>solution to address the client’s challenges. Our solution positioned Instamojo as a category inventor by highlighting its distinct value proposition and establishing the company as a trusted partner for small businesses. We recommended that the client build <b>Media Relations </b>to showcase how Instamojo championed the growth of small businesses through its suite of solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a direct impact of our focussed and rigorous approach, there was better understanding of Instamojo’s value proposition among key journalists. This in turn resulted in <b>145x</b> increase in visibility for Instamojo among standalone and industry stories around the MSMEs, Fintech and the payments space</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our media outreach programme comprised relationship building meetings, increasing Instamojo&#8217;s participation in relevant industry stories and participation in key industry awards/events. As a direct impact of our focussed and rigorous approach, there was better understanding of Instamojo’s value proposition among key journalists. This in turn resulted in <b>145x </b>increase in visibility for Instamojo among standalone and industry stories around the MSMEs, Fintech and the payments space. The PRactice placed high-impact stories in The Economic Times, Business Standard, Business Today, Forbes, Bloomberg Quint, Mint, VC Circle. We also leveraged our electronic media relationships to secure opportunities with marquee television shows such as &#8216;Young Turks&#8217; on CNBC TV18 and &#8216;Leaders of Tomorrow&#8217; along with ‘By the Way’ on ET Now. We established thought leadership for the founder, Sampad Swain, through participation in key industry events and awards such as TechSparks, India Fintech Awards, Business World Fintech Summit and Business World 40 Under 40 Achievers. In short, The PRactice built a strong voice for Instamojo among its different stakeholders.</p>

</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We began our partnership with Netradyne with Message Mapping, our messaging architecture that keeps the various stakeholders in mind and reaches out to them with relevant information about the company, the leadership,  the technology and the product. We developed <b>Strategic Media Relations </b>plan and invited key  journalists to have a preview of the technology even before the launch. We developed relationships with mainstream and auto-media and led with an industry category sensitization approach. We successfully positioned the company as a dynamic start-up, pioneering road safety solutions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As an outcome of our interactions, key journalists are now aware of the road safety challenge and Netradyne’s AI solution. Media perceives Netradyne as a thought leader in this completely new space of technology for automotive safety.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XPRIZE is one of the world’s biggest facilitators of radical innovations that have the potential to bring about exponential change.</p>
<p>XPRIZE incentivizes solutions for challenges that are audacious, yet achievable. The non-profit organization planned to launch two of its prizes &#8211; Anu and Naveen Jain Women’s Safety XPRIZE and Water Abundance XPRIZE in India. The challenge was that India was a unique, diverse and unchartered territory for the client.</p>
<p>XPRIZE partnered with The PRactice to build awareness of the challenges in India, and encourage Indian and global teams to participate. We designed an integrated <strong>Brand Communication</strong> strategy. This included <strong>Strategic Media Relations</strong>,<strong> Digital Engagement</strong>, <strong>Content Development</strong> and <strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>. We engaged with the media extensively and it payed off in the form of great coverage in traditional, regional, new age and digital media. We used existing social media properties to run a campaign that highlighted women’s safety and water scarcity issues and roped in various stakeholder comprising individuals and organizations who believed in making a difference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an outcome of our integrated strategy, India ranked second (after US) in terms of maximum registered applications for both the prizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The extensive publicity, wide print and digital media coverage, interviews, discussions, meetings and created brand recall which led to the desired response. 85 teams registered for the Women Safety XPRIZE of which 20 Teams were from India. 98 teams registered for the Water Abundance XPRIZE of which 11 Teams were from India. As an outcome of our integrated strategy, India ranked second (after US) in terms of maximum registered applications for both the prizes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
The Handloom School (THS) is a non-profit organization born of the need to preserve India’s handloom industry which is under threat. When power looms were introduced and mass-produced textiles became more commercially viable, they grabbed a huge market share.  Unfortunately, this spelt doom for the traditional handloom weavers of India. Many weavers started looking at alternate livelihoods. Handloom weaving became a dying art. THS intervened and developed a specialized education program for young weavers. The idea was to bring handloom weavers back to the fold and to bridge the gap between traditional weaving and new competencies. </p>
<p>
To get recognition for this program, THS had to promote its case to relevant stakeholders and get their support.  THS identified The PRactice as the perfect partner to reach out to people and organizations who could further the cause. </p>
<blockquote><p>The organic, no-marketing-dollars-spent Social Media campaign was hugely liked by readers and the engagement grew by 800%. The weavers of The Handloom School received orders worth Rs.13 lakhs during the fashion week. </p></blockquote>
<p>
As part of our Stakeholder Engagement program, we identified  The Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) as a key influencer and made a pitch to promote handloom weaves from Maheshwar. The Director of FDCI was convinced by our pitch and THS was offered complimentary participation in the Amazon India Fashion Week (AIFW), 2017. We went the extra mile and initiated a parallel tie-up with Good Earth who agreed to sponsor the event. The collection was presented at Amazon Fashion Week, as the lead ramp show on March 15th, 2017. </p>
<p>
Our strategy included <b>Message Development, Strategic Media Relations, Digital Engagement, Communication Design and Stakeholder Engagement </b> as solutions. The outcome was incredible. Leading publications carried detailed stories about India’s unique handloom art. Over 98 lakh impressions were generated! The organic, no-marketing-dollars-spent Social Media campaign was hugely liked by readers and the engagement grew by 800%. As a result of the activities, awareness grew, and the weavers of The Handloom School received orders worth Rs.13 lakhs during the fashion week. What’s more,  the WomenWeave Charitable Trust also worked with us to launch of a collection of handwoven textiles.</p>

The challenges were two-fold: they wanted to accentuate awareness about cleft deformity and its impact on an individual and their family and launch fund-raising efforts to eventually make their India program self-sustainable.</p>
<blockquote><p>The relevant media coverage we achieved evoked an 80 per cent share of voice across media channels during a high-profile event involving actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Our <b>Strategic Media Relations program</b> focused on building visibility for Smile Train across all channels including lifestyle magazines, financials, mainlines and vernaculars by mobilizing a network of supporters including Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Sanjiv Bajaj, Deepa Malik and others. The relevant media coverage we achieved evoked an 80 per cent share of voice across media channels during a high-profile event involving actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.</p>
<p>
To initiate and sustain fundraising efforts, we deployed our <b>Digital Engagement program</b> to plan and execute digital campaigns on Facebook, Twitter and Google adwords to amplify conversations around clefts, and to promote the ad campaigns on donations to tap new donors. The outcome was positive: we raised funds, and Smile Train India also started to enjoy generous donations from dormant donors along with appreciation mails.</p>

The state of Rajasthan is widely acclaimed for their majestic royal palaces, forts, camel caravans, textiles, and festivals. Yet, there was an unexplored side to Rajasthan, which the  Department of Tourism was keen to promote.</p>
<p>
The PRactice’s mandate: to reposition the brand by changing the tourist’s perspective of Rajasthan and promote the unexplored destinations of Rajasthan. We took a dual approach: to sustain positive conversations around  brand positioning and drive Rajasthan’s diverse offerings that include wildlife, food, adventure tourism, culture, heritage and luxury experiences. Secondly, we had to inspire more travellers to visit uncharted destinations.</P></p>
<blockquote><p>We took a dual approach: to sustain positive conversations around  brand positioning and drive Rajasthan’s diverse offerings that include wildlife, food, adventure tourism, culture, heritage and luxury experiences.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Our <b>Strategic Media Relations program</b> focused on familiarization trips designed around the new positioning. Each familiarization trip included a combination of freelancers, media publications, bloggers and photographers to impact a larger audience across different media channels. We leveraged key festivals and events like Jaipur Lit Fest, Rajasthan Diwas, Pushkar Festival, Jaipur photo Festival and celebrity visits to the state for occasions; capitalised on trade shows and on key airline partnerships like Air Asia&#8217;s new flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jaipur. </P></p>
<p>
In a span of six months, we had organized 11 media trips, which included two familiarization tours with international freelance media, key authors and personalities from the Jaipur Lit Fest. We had successfully initiated effective, organic feature stories on the seldom seen splendors of the state. Our <b>Strategic Brand Communication program</b> achieved the desired outcome  &#8212; we ran up 1,000 media stories and 150 million media impressions on the lesser known face of Rajasthan.</p>

<b>Brand Communication programs</b> for Maple had to initially cut through trial inhibitors such as limited awareness about pure maple syrup from Canada. Viewed as an expensive product, the brand was not easily available as well. The PRactice’s objective was to enhance market penetration of the brand to 100 per cent in India and position it as a nutritive, gourmet product. To achieve this, we launched a <b>Strategic Communication program</b>, which focussed on amplifying health, nutrition and culinary benefits of maple syrup. This strategy was brought to life through direct to consumer activations, digital engagement, media relations and stakeholder engagement. Annual market study and perception audits were conducted as well to customise marketing and promotional strategy in India.</p>

<p>
Our<b> Strategic Media Relations program</b>included successful collaborations with leading English newspapers to run syndicated articles, and with a TV channel and radio to promote maple dishes. Our <b>Stakeholder Engagement program </b> vigorously tapped key influencers &#8212; chefs, nutritionists, bloggers and celebrities (Sonam Kapoor, Malaika Arora Khan Jacqueline Fernandez etc.,) to champion maple syrup as a healthier option on their social media handles. In just three months, from September to December 2017, we had reached over 31.5 million people purely through the celebrity stories.</p>
<p><b>The Digital Engagement program</b> initiatives concentrated on strategic amplification of news coverage through different social media platforms. We targeted 35,000 people but we achieved a fan base of 209, 838 on Facebook and notched up 1,84, 998 YouTube views in the course of one year. The Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers conducted a consumer audit in India and their findings were significant: the awareness of maple syrup in India had shot up from 17 per cent  in 2016 to 37 per cent in 2017.</p>
