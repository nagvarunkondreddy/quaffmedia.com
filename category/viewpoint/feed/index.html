				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>On clash, shock and other effects of cultural intermingling.</p></blockquote>
<p>In ‘Sapiens’, the 2014 bestseller on the history of our human species, historian Yuval Noah Harari defines culture as follows:</p>
<p>“Myths and fictions [that allowed people] to think in certain ways, to behave in accordance with certain standards, to want certain things, and to observe certain rules.”</p>
<p>In essence, Harari says, culture is a network of artificial instincts that enable humans to cooperate and stay dominant.</p>
<p>It may be based on stories we have made up but culture is important to our species. However, as a word used widely to describe the many ways that we band together, it is often hard to pin down.</p>
<p>Some cultures are a natural result of geographical borders. Countries and their people are typically bound by language, food and celebrations, among other things. Even in a country as regionally diverse as India, it is possible to come together for activities of undisputed importance such as cricket. There are strong cultures that flourish inside workplaces or institutions. Others are more behaviour-based and can be positive or subversive in nature, e.g. a culture of biking in a city or of drinking on a college campus.</p>
<p>When two established cultures come in contact with one another, the effects of the encounter provide material for both sociologists and movie makers. In the movies, one common culture clash scenario revolves around forbidden love. Maybe it is some evolutionary instinct for preserving genetic lines but when a young person attempts to marry outside their cultural milieu, push back from the family is often strong and swift.</p>
<p>Way back in 1981, <i>Ek duuje ke liye&#8217;s </i>portrayal of a doomed love affair showed us that in India, North is North and South is South and when the two do meet, it doesn&#8217;t always end well.</p>
<p>In 2014, Two States handled a similar theme (this time through a relationship between a Tamil girl and a Punjabi boy) but with doses of humor and a more sunny worldview. The fact that the theme was still relevant more than three decades after the first movie speaks to the stubbornness of cultural barriers. But parental opposition was weaker in the modern tale and not viewed as insurmountable, indicating that we have made progress on this front.</p>
<p>In the 2015 Hollywood movie, Brooklyn, we see a softer juxtaposition of cultures in Italian American Tony’s courtship of Ellis, a native of Ireland and a recent immigrant to the city. Set in the 1950s, the romance between the two blossoms on neutral ground but amid some clear cultural differences. One lighthearted but sweet scene shows her going over to meet his family for the first time. They are warm and friendly but serve her an Italian dish that is completely unfamiliar to her: spaghetti. As she studies and weighs the best way to tackle it, we are reminded of a time before dishes like spaghetti became global cultural exports and when there were no easy channels for cuisines to spread.</p>
<p>There are other movies that also handle the theme of cultural conflict with sensitivity. In Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood plays a crabby Korean War veteran living in a predominantly Southeast Asian neighborhood of Detroit where gang violence has become the norm. He carries a lot of baggage from his past that colors his views on immigrants in his section of town. However, through an unlikely friendship with the young Asian man living next door, he finds a way to move past his prejudices.</p>
<p>When there are two or more cultural groups attempting to co-exist in an area, such clashes may arise and resolve over time. But for the lone individual who transitions into a new culture &#8211; whether of a place or group &#8211; there can be a real if temporary sense of disorientation. The culture shock effect wanes as an individual adapts to the new environment, modifying values and customs in the attempt to assimilate. For later groups of migrants, however, the landing is likely to be softer. These days, wherever Indians move to in the world, they can find a recreated version of home involving community, activities and food to ensure that they never feel homesick or out of place.</p>
<p>Food, the ultimate barrier in cultural assimilation, can also serve as a big unifier of cultures. If spaghetti was alien to Ellis in 1950s Brooklyn, it has now become very recognizable fare in most parts of the world. Various ethnic influences on American cuisine have transformed it from its blander origins. Now you can have anything from banh mi to falafel to samosas on the streets of many American cities. In a country like India, food is also a geographical marker of sorts. You know you have crossed over from Tamil Nadu into Karnataka when ragi mudde shows up on the menus of roadside joints. But it is also an interesting exercise to map the mix of ingredients and cooking styles used across the country. What we’ll find is that while each state has a distinct cuisine, the influence of neighboring states is unmistakable, especially along the edges.</p>
<p>When cultures collide, the fallout can be violent or unpleasant. But, as these cinematic and real-life examples show us, it can also be beautiful and eye-opening. Not to mention delicious.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>A look at shifts that will continue to influence our lives, thinking and behaviour in the near future.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> Privacy as a fundamental right<br />
</strong><br />
On August 24, 2017, the Supreme Court of India declared privacy a constitutional right. It was a rare unanimous judgement that has far-reaching implications for Indians.</p>
<p>As defined in the judgement, privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, the home and sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards individual autonomy and recognises the ability of the individual to control vital aspects of his or her life. Personal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy. Privacy protects heterogeneity and recognises the plurality and diversity of our culture. However, what appears to be less clear are the implications the judgement will have on the use of state power in collecting personal information, as it recognises that there are compelling state interests in collecting such information.</p>
<p>For the common man to experience the true rights bestowed by this judgement, we need to see the establishment of a detailed and transparent information architecture detailing which agency or vendor shares what information with whom. This should go hand in hand with proper privacy architecture and a channel to protect yourself if the state messes with your identity.</p>
<p><strong>To question or not to question</strong></p>
<p>Never before has our ability to question things come under such intense scrutiny as now. Are we losing our ability to think as a country? This was quite evident across the country on the issue of ‘sedition’ at JNU. While the intellectuals were delivering lectures on nationalism with much clarity, easily understandable to the students of JNU, the rest of the people in the country could hardly make out anything constructive from these debates. The fact that there is a disconnect between the ‘public’ and ‘intellectuals’ is something that needs to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>news channels &#8211; ostensibly designed to represent public thinking and spirit in a vibrant society &#8211; have been reduced to a ‘shouting business’. In the absence of measured channels and dialogue, there is no room for a critical culture to evolve in India.</p>
<p>Do we need an alternative platform to discuss alternative views while steering clear of noise and propaganda? Its ultimate aim should be to engage the public in thinking about the kind of society they want to live in. But all of this calls for us to develop the faculty of ‘doubting’ since it is that which leads to questioning.</p>
<p>How do you make the public question? Especially in a technological and informational age where knowledge systems and information per se become the instruments of power and domination. Can professionals like you and me play the role of uncovering the hidden public issues that otherwise remain behind technocratic walls? Can we use our expertise in our respective fields to help the public in challenging the hegemonic designs of today’s informational and technocratic age? To nurture a role like this, there is the prerequisite need of a secular society where all and sundry have equal social and economic rights irrespective of their religious adherence. Questioning is the very foundational aspect of democracy that religious and cultural groups are trying to suppress so that their hegemony in society persists.</p>
<p>So, in 2018, will you begin to question?</p>

<p><strong>When women find voice</strong></p>
<p>The Harvey Weinstein case has opened the floodgates, it seems, for women all over the world to step forward to call out sexual misconduct by men in positions of power. Women and men took to social media in their millions in the ‘#MeToo’ campaign, making it a watershed moment drawing attention to the rampant problem. Much has been written and continues to be written about the topic. Perspectives range from being completely objective to being purely personal. The broader questions being asked globally are:</p>
<p>&#8211; Is disclosure enough? How does society make amends and change the situation?<br />
&#8211; Is disclosure always fair? What of the male lives ruined by a single ‘accusation’?<br />
&#8211; Will the socio dynamics between men and women change and what will be the implications both in the workplace as well as socially?</p>
<p>In the Indian context while we have had at least three high profile cases of women from the entertainment sector speaking out about their sexual abuse perpetrators, the context and climate is far more complex. People express views more privately – they are not ready to make waves; be it stars or just ‘everyday victims’. The social stigma for the person as well as their extended family, the ability to be shut out from careers and livelihoods, the ingrained values of a patriarchal society where boys grow up with a sense of entitlement &#8211; all these make for a very different, multi-layered and complex social context for Indian women to find their voice. The signs are there. Some are feeling more empowered to do so. The true journey to finding voice fearlessly has a long and tortuous way forward – but there are clear indications that the movement can gain momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Consenting adults and gender justice</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court has issued notice that it intends to re-examine Section 497 of the IPC on adultery, a legal provision that it sees as ‘archaic’. It wants to re-examine it on the grounds that it absolves the woman of any liability in a prosecuted cause, that it goes against gender neutrality and treats a woman as a possession, thereby denting her independent identity as a woman.</p>
<p>From a woman’s perspective, it reinforces the submissiveness of women within a marriage. It plays to the overarching patriarchal structure of society and state. The argument against it is that no marriage or alliance should take away one’s right over one’s own body. “The question here is whether the state should be entering into a private space between two consenting adults”, says Talish Ray, Managing Partner TRS law offices and Project Director, Girlsgottaknow (an information initiative for young women).</p>
<p>There have been other developments aimed at furthering gender justice. The Lok Sabha bill criminalising triple talaq is one. Technology, through platforms like Tinder, is empowering woman with previously unheard of levels of freedom to explore relationships. It would seem that finally gender politics are moving in favour of more equality and justice for women. But societal pressures to toe the patriarchal line remain strong and binding and it will be a while before that changes. We can just say the wheels are in motion.</p>

<p><strong>The politics of censorship</strong></p>
<p>The Padmavati row once again exposes the hypocrisy of our society and political system. The basic tenets of democracy are again being held hostage by hot-headed nationalism and certain vested interests. For its part, the government seems unable or disinclined to safeguard the interests of storytellers and story lovers. It has once again sacrificed constitutional guarantees such as freedom of expression at the altar of divisive politics.</p>
<p>The facts around the issue are well known. Padmavati, experts say, is not mentioned in any recognized historical text. Her story first appeared in a Sufi composition which is treated as a source for the history of Mewar. The main objection raised here involves the alleged distortion of historical facts, something that could have been handled in an objective manner. However, such issues typically don a saffron colour and become hot button items on the agendas of political parties.</p>
<p>There is more to this than meets the eye. There could be other motives to explain why the issue has been allowed to dominate the news. Is it a ploy to divert attention from questions on demonetization, GST and dwindling jobs, driving people’s attention from economic worries to less weighty concerns of nationalism and Hindutva?</p>
<p>Possibly. But while our political parties continue to exploit such opportunities, creative license in storytelling takes another blow to its chest.</p>

<p><strong>The rise of the age of algorithms</strong></p>
<p>Predictive reasoning, the key to guiding machine behaviour, has been transformed over the last few decades. When Alan Turing designed the initial machine, machine behaviour was driven by certain specific inputs and was dependent on the man-machine interface. Due to the fragmented nature of connectivity, to feed machine learning. Computing was largely number driven, electromechanical in approach and limited by both people’s assumptions and reach.</p>
<p>What then is different today? Largely seamless connectivity and expanded reach have enabled the rise of self-learning software that is steadily replacing people. This software, or AI, is non-judgemental, flexible and eliminates the bias inherent in human induced reasoning. The codes that form AI are not set in stone but exist in transforming predictive reasoning based on real-time interaction between machines and people.</p>
<p>With human bias being gradually removed from the picture, we are entering a new era in analytics. It has also raised questions about what happens as algorithms/software keep increasing in sophistication, along with the self-awareness to generate machine behaviour devoid of human bias and correlated thought. The news story last year about Facebook bots communicating in their own self-developed language underscores this reality. It’s something we need to be mindful of, without giving in to alarmism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>The stories and voices that will help catalyse women’s empowerment in our society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Has the women’s rights movement finally hit its stride in our country? To answer that question, we have to examine how change, particularly cultural change, happens. Large-scale cultural change begins from the inside and is usually organic in nature, with people, or a fraction of the people first adapting to these over time before it becomes a mass movement or habit. The psyche of a society is an inscrutable animal; it accepts and rejects in its own timeline and travels its own trajectory. The word ‘cultural’ itself is a composite, a sum total, so any protest against this would only be if it is forced, administered willy-nilly or feels too foreign.</p>
<p>By that yardstick, the recent uprising against sexual harassment can be viewed as an organic shift. Statistics indicate that a very high percentage of women experience assault or harassment at some point in their lives. The #MeToo phenomenon confirms what we always suspected. But the question remains whether it will have the same resonance or impact in India as in the West. Sexism is a global woe, with India, like any other country in the world, exhibiting patterns specific to itself.</p>
<p>There is convergence of experience in some ways. A short story published in the New Yorker in December 2017 went viral, primarily because of a jolting ending in which a woman who ends a relationship with a man has the verbal equivalent of acid thrown at her. In India, in the days when arranged marriages were the norm, families could take the fall for rejecting a suitor. But in a modern and more empowered era, Indian women who say no risk having acid hurled at them &#8211; either literally or metaphorically.</p>
<p>But, at many other levels, there are differences in what women need or seek when it comes to change differences dictated by geography, social class or more. The feminist ideals of those of us born into relative privilege are unlikely to resonate with a tea stall vendor or a household worker.</p>
<p>From time to time, these differences make us sit up and take notice. Several years ago, I went on a road trip with a group of female friends. We were happy at the chance to get in touch with our core identities as women, rather than as mothers, wives, daughters. We broke our journey at a guest house the first night and woke up the next morning to have breakfast before heading out again. Breakfast was served to us &#8211; by two undernourished and clearly underage girls. All of a sudden, our own struggle for empowerment paled in contrast to the life experiences of these girls.</p>
<p>Such incidents prompt us to question whether there is really a ‘one size fits all’ when it comes to feminism and women’s rights.</p>
<p>I believe real change will happen when we can put ourselves in the shoes of others. If we are lucky to have access to the tools and implements of change, then we should be able to use these to make a difference to those who don’t. The #MeToo movement will also reach new heights, I believe, when women who have not personally been victims of harassment add their voices to the fray.</p>
<p>Many writers have inserted themselves in the movement through their work. The themes and stories of contemporary fiction highlight female experience across eras and cultures. For example, ‘Pyre’ by Perumal Murugan, ‘The Kaunteyas’ by Madhavi Mahadevan and ‘Hotel Iris’ by Yoko Ogawa are all powerful stories that illustrate how women helping women (or not) can impact lives and outcomes.</p>
<p>There are also literary events organized purely to showcase feminist literature. These are important to shine a light on concerns beyond the traditional issues that mainstream literature festivals cover. With their niche focus, such events are better placed to explore all the aspects &#8211; good, bad and ugly &#8211; of being a woman in India.</p>
<p>Cultural change is spasmodic and seismic, happening as and when events enable it. In a book titled ‘I Want To Destroy Myself’, author Malika Amar Shaikh recounts her personal story with bravery and grit. For her the time was right to tell her story, and for readers like me it was the right moment to learn that no woman is alone.</p>
<p>I see the pushback against certain topics as a sign that the wheels of the movement are continuing to turn. Censorship of movies and books always exposes the nerve and pulse of a society; what people are really thinking and feeling. What we refuse to read or watch tell us what we truly fear. The pseudo sense of security that we wrap ourselves with at nights comes ripping off us when we react in a knee-jerk fashion. In a society that is moving towards gender equality, Indian women are becoming more and more aware of their rights, and are developing, rightly, a taste for independence, for higher education, for anything really that a man has access to. Men, on the other hand, stand to lose traditional advantages and are unsure of how much should be ‘allowed’. A woman wearing the pants is a statement of power but a man who wears the skirt at home is an image of weakness. When we can treat both expressions in the same positive vein, we will have made the transition to a truly gender equal world.</p>
<p>My most recent novel, ’The Girl Who Couldn’t Love’, has a heroine who doesn’t buy into the usual feminine images; she lives her life on her own terms, is shaped by her own sense of right and/or wrong. To me this is a step, however small, in the right direction and towards the culture of humanism &#8211; which in the end is the only culture that survives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In a conversation with Viewpoint, Elahe Hiptoola discusses the power of the moving image to tell stories tucked away in the shadowy corners of our society and to stir up reformative social movements</p></blockquote>
<p>It is a conscious choice filmmakers have to make. You  can either choose to ignore the different raging concerns in society and plunge into a disconnected world or you can choose to make life around you better. Or, you can make an escapist satire like Charlie Chaplin did with his <em>Great Dictator</em>. But it is undeniable today, that cinema and the moving image provide a powerful medium to create change and stir up a cultural revolution. This medium has the power to tell stories and plant images in your mind; to provide potent ways through which to spread ideas and thoughts. It is a platform from which filmmakers can gently nudge out an issue simmering in the backdrop of our lives &#8211; things we refuse to see, let alone acknowledge.</p>
<p>How do we choose to turn the camera on a particular social problem? Why are we drawn here? In the case of <em>Lakshmi</em>, a hard-hitting film focusing on human trafficking and child prostitution, Nagesh [Kukunoor] had stumbled upon the real-life experience of a young girl who took her traffickers to court. He had been invited to visit a safe house sheltering and rehabilitating rescued sex workers outside Ongole village in Andhra Pradesh. After hearing their horrific stories we decided to put our time and money into making a film on human trafficking, rather than writing a cheque and moving on.</p>
<p>The girl who inspired the movie had been sold at the age of thirteen and forced into prostitution. After she was rescued by the police, she began her fight for justice with the help of an NGO. It was an extremely important story to be told, to jolt audiences out of their safe zones. In India, 44,000 children are abducted every year and 3 million are trafficked for sex. She was the first one in Andhra Pradesh to take traffickers to court and nearly 93 of them have been convicted so far. We wanted to tell a really powerful story to support the battle against human trafficking and we found it in this girl. But we’ve just covered the  tip of the iceberg because the kind of inhumanity these women are subject to is unbelievable.</p>
<p>At the 2017 Palm Springs International Film Festival, where <em>Lakshmi </em>won the best audience award, there were shaken and distraught women eager to do something to help. We raised Rs 12 lakhs for <em>Lakshmi</em>, and Nagesh- through Prerena in Mumbai &#8211; has educated 86 children of sex workers. The film was screened at Kamathipura to an incredibly emotional response. There are many issues in India and they can be overwhelming. You have to pick your battles and choose to work on issues that are close to your heart. <em>Dor</em>, for example, is about women’s empowerment on the surface but when you delve deeper, you notice the film works at other levels too. Here’s an educated and progressive Muslim woman, Zeenat (played by Gul Panag), who does not cover her head, and ends up teaching a cowering, Hindu child bride some significant things about life.  The Hindu protagonist dressed always in a stark plain blue outfit, is the oppressed woman. Her Muslim ally &#8211; in sharp contrast to prevailing beliefs &#8211; is the spunky and modern woman who proves to be the game-changer in the film.</p>
<p>It is an absorbing story embellished with subtle messages. We have tried to break the stereotypical images surrounding Muslim women in particular. Our point here is that you cannot slot people according to the community or religion to which they belong.</p>
<p>In <em>Iqbal</em>, we wanted to promote the idea of a more inclusive society for the physically challenged. We wanted the audience to forget the protagonist had a disability. In our films, we have stuck to producing probing but engaging stories with happy endings. You can show a problem to the world but if you don’t also offer a solution, you risk losing the audience.</p>
<p>Filmmakers have a choice to make an entertaining film like <em>Raees </em>or to make a <em>My Brother Nikhil </em>(on homosexuality and AIDS) or a  <em>Lipstick Under My Burqa </em>(about women’s empowerment). And today, audiences are growing for such kinds of films that are being made without big stars. Filmmaking has become cheaper today with easily accessible technology and there are multiple platforms to release films, from Netflix to Youtube.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately in India today, there is a growing wave  of intolerance. But the pushback against progressive movements is something we are seeing worldwide. I don’t believe a cultural revolution  is unfolding as yet. Issues like same sex marriage should not cause a stir in 2018. There are more and more young filmmakers out there As communicated to Viewpoint who are willing to test uncharted waters and tackle taboo topics. But the government continues to pander to religious and other groups at the expense of socially relevant storytelling. For example, <em>S Durga</em>, a macabre tale on the safety of women in India was not allowed to be screened at the international film festival in Goa in 2017 because a sexual adjective was attached to the name of a Hindu goddess. In reality, however, the movie had nothing to do with religion. Why view life through such a narrow lens? Cinema and the moving image are powerful tools for societal change and you should not take this power away from a filmmaker. Their work can be real fodder for a cultural revolution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>If ideas and debate are enabled by free artistic expression, then censorship of the arts essentially puts a lid on them.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Google search for the word ‘censorship’ returns this clear-eyed definition from the website of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU):</p>
<p>“The suppression of words, images, or ideas that are ‘offensive’’, happens whenever some people succeed in imposing their personal political or moral values on others.”</p>
<p>“Censorship by the government”, the site goes on to say “is unconstitutional”.</p>
<p>At the heart of the issue, however, is the propensity to offend. But it is not always clear who stands to be offended and where the censoring agency draws its authority from.</p>
<p>In an issue from last year, The Economist tackled this point in an eloquent defense of free speech:</p>
<p>&#8230;the idea has spread that people and groups have a right not to be offended. This may sound innocuous. Politeness is a virtue, after all. But if I have a right not to be offended, that means someone must police what you say about me, or about the things I hold dear, such as my ethnic group, religion, or even political beliefs. Since offence is subjective, the power to police it is both vast and arbitrary. (Under Attack; The Economist; June 4, 2016)</p>
<p>Historically, art has often been at the at the receiving end of censorship. Some of the works targeted are well known; others may have gained notoriety after being singled out for special treatment. Current visitors to the Sistine Chapel may find nothing scandalous about the fresco that covers its altar wall. It looks like an impressive piece of Renaissance art in the signature style of its creator, Michelangelo, who also painted the chapel’s renowned ceiling. But in 1541 when the work was completed, its depiction of largely nude figures ascending or descending to their afterlife fates was too much to digest for the pope who commissioned Michelangelo’s assistant to photoshop the piece with a few strategically painted pieces of cloth.</p>
<p>As the head of the Roman Catholic Church, the pope presumably had the moral authority to censor the work. And in the 1500s, it is unlikely that anyone in his devout congregation would have had a problem with it. But self-styled defenders of societal values &#8211; such as the Indian movie censor board under its previous chief &#8211; are on shakier ground. The board’s clumsy attempts to shield us from material that could morally corrupt us have been widely lampooned through Sanskaari James Bond jokes and other internet memes.</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes are adept at muzzling writers, thinkers, journalists and others who question their actions. One of the most chilling displays of state supported censorship took place in 1933 when a German student group launched a book burning campaign to purge the country of  its ‘un-German’ spirit &#8211; essentially code for Jewish and communist writings and other ideologies. The tomecide destroyed upwards of 25,000 books and featured fiery speeches by Nazi leaders, including one in Berlin by the party’s propaganda machine, Josef Goebbels. In the speech, he exhorted the crowd to say: “No to decadence and moral corruption!” and “Yes to decency and morality in family and state!” Today, a memorial at the same site in Berlin reminds visitors of an event that kicked off a period of ruthless censorship. It includes these words that were actually written by a 19th century Jewish poet but proved to be darkly prophetic for Nazi Germany: “Where they burn books, they will also ultimately burn people”.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a work may be censored after a more careful consideration of the impact it may have. This happened, for example, when a NY art gallery director decided to whitewash a mural that he had commissioned an Italian street artist to complete. The mural depicted the coffins of war casualties draped with dollar bills, instead of flags. The director decided that, though the work was intended to be a broader critique of conflict around the world, it could be construed as being disrespectful to war veterans. And this was not a position he felt the gallery could endorse.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this seems reasonable. But free speech advocates can argue that he suppressed a viewpoint that could have enriched public discourse. As a post by Art Media Agency, an art-focused news site, says: “The work [was] covered before debate, or critique, could begin.”</p>
<p>The question that is becoming increasingly relevant for the age we live in is this: Is it more important to protect the right of a person to not be offended over the right of another to express their point of view? What’s clear is that as long as artists, writers and other creative individuals continue to push the boundaries of artistic expression, there will always be people ready to tell them why they cannot do it. But we need these truth tellers who hold a mirror up to our world &#8211; now more than ever.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>What makes ideas withstand the rigours of time? As attention spans are shrinking faster than coral reefs in oceans, the authors argue for moving past transient ideas to the more enduring ones that stay relevant over time.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>“A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.” </em>Mark Twain<br />
<em><br />
</em>We are all in showbiz today. Each one of us.</p>
<p>Social media blithely dishes out honorary degrees in creativity, or so we believe. Doffs a hat at the new, and the unexpected. Puns abound, there are dollops of pop philosophy, and almost everything is applauded or deplored.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum estimates that we collectively send more than 30 million messages on Facebook and almost 3,50,000 tweets every minute.</p>
<p>Caught in this multimedia matrix, we have become change makers. Each one of us. The Internet has offered us a huge canvas to explore, create or merely participate. Accessibility to information has opened unthinkable avenues for people to create change, in small ways and big.</p>
<p>If every drop makes an ocean, then every idea matters: crowdfunding, creating a petition for change, signing it, sharing it – even if it falls way short of the desired numbers to make any perceivable impact. What the Internet does is that it brings an idea or a cause to the fore that would have otherwise languished and perhaps died a quiet death. Now, at least there will be a few grievers by its grave.</p>
<p>Ideas abound in the times we live. Yet, our problems are graver than ever. Political chaos, climate change, nuclear threats, epidemics, mass killings – all sounding a death knell to our future. Ideas seem to be playing catch-up to the burgeoning problems and challenges of our times.</p>
<p>There are ideas for the new millennium’s problems, a unique “odd and even” vehicle formula to solve traffic snarls on roads, or a hundred ways to clear up a frothing lake. However, no idea sticks. Sometimes, it seems  ideas are churned out to deflect the real issues. They are spun just to grab eyeballs.</p>
<p>As the ideas whirl around us, how does one idea &#8211; good or bad &#8211; become the differentiator? What is that “trigger” that makes you douse yourself with a bucket of ice and post a video online to participate in the Ice Bucket video challenge? Why does a single Facebook post &#8211; among the many about standing up against injustice in India &#8211; with a catchy campaign title of “Not in My Name” get you all charged up to march and protest with a thousand others?</p>
<p>Bestselling author Malcolm Gladwell famously labelled this trigger the ‘tipping point’, that magic moment when an idea, trend or social behaviour crosses a threshold, tips and spreads like wildfire.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is difficult to zero in on this ‘X’ factor. “If people could crack this code they would be millionaires,” admits Rahul D’Cunha, creative head of Da Cunha Communications Pvt Ltd. the Mumbai-based ad agency, which has handled the Amul account since 1996. He believes an idea can sing if it is able to latch onto an “emotion” people can identify with. Amul’s mascot – the young Indian blue-haired girl in a polka dotted frock, has stood the test of time. Conceived in 1967, the mascot continues to regale with tongue-in-cheek humour.</p>
<p>After 50 long years, the Amul girl still picks an utterly-butterly trending topic and unerringly zeroes in on the “prevailing emotion” in the country. Be it the pent-up frustration over demonetisation or exultation over a highly popular Bollywood movie.</p>
<p>A similar idea of the “common man”, a silent witness to a chaotic world, was conceived by R K Laxman in 1951. The genius of the man was such that if we were to rerun those cartoons today, they would still hold relevance.</p>
<p>What then makes ideas stand the test of time? Striving to analyse the “trigger”, many international marketing experts have linked influencers to the spread of ideas. Based on the notion that a few people can influence the behaviour of the majority, marketers often target bloggers and celebrities to push their ideas. The Rally for Rivers call, the government’s drive for toilets for all and safety of women in India have taken that route.</p>
<p>In their book ‘Made to Stick’, authors Chip &amp; Dan Heath list a few principles that can lead to “sticky” ideas. One is a truism that can be applied to other areas such as writing: keep the idea simple, devoid of any clutter, and strip it down to its core.</p>
<p>Unexpected twists and turns and other movie-like elements can help, the book suggests. But ultimately, ideas stick if they are credible, relevant, stacked with details and can be executed consistently and long enough for them to touch us in some way.</p>
<p>Most ideas today seem to stop at instigating awareness. Yet, as our lives get more complicated, we need ideas that go beyond awareness to managing the issues at hand.</p>
<p>Standing up for that elusive something that defines a generation &#8211; such as Woodstock which still resonates almost half a century later &#8211; surely can be played over. We were almost there with the Anna Hazare movement, as people from diverse ages and backgrounds came together, desperately hoping to hook onto a substantial idea, an idea for a corruption-free India where people are accountable.</p>
<p>It has spun many other ideas, including citizen movements, a move towards more transparency and accountability, a new political party and is still moving. That is the power of a lasting idea. We need more of them in our world today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>How and why do certain ideas spread? The answers may be embedded deep within us.</p></blockquote>
<p>All through the 80s and much of the 90s, Fair &amp; Lovely sold us creams based on the idea that a fair complexion is an asset, primarily in the marriage market. As we moved into the 2000s, the story had to be updated to reflect the aspirations of women with more than marriage. The brand also expanded its reach, now targeting men with the message that lighter skin delivers better results in the dating game.</p>
<p>Is this a regressive story sold to us by a profit-focused brand? Have we allowed ourselves to be brainwashed and to buy into a beauty ideal created by a cosmetics company?</p>
<p>Marketing guru Seth Godin argues in a book provocatively titled “All Marketers Are Liars” that people are motivated by certain innate desires and shrewd marketers are just adept at tapping into this. Marketers cannot manufacture needs. These exist, at some level or the other, within us.</p>
<p>Fair &amp; Lovely did not create a desire for lighter skin among the larger population. We’ve always wanted it, if our history with natural skin lightening products such as sandalwood and turmeric is an indicator. The brand just made it more convenient for people by packaging that promise in a tube.</p>
<p>Our fears and insecurities fuel many of our choices as consumers. One recent consumer trend that is hard to decipher, given the relatively narrow roads in most Indian cities, is the increasing popularity of SUVs. However, we may be misreading the trend if we interpret it just as a growing preference for SUVs. In reality, people are gravitating towards cars that are more SUV-like, not necessarily in size but in appearance. A good example is the Renault Kwid, an entry-level compact car with a more muscular look. The Kwid, to use a boxing phrase, ‘punches above its weight’ with a striking front grill and other strong design features. A person behind the wheel of a small car is most fearful of being hit or edged out by other motorists. An SUV-like compact car such as the Kwid is still easy to maneuver but also sends a message to others to keep their distance.</p>
<p>Our actions stem from our beliefs. And our beliefs are based on the stories we buy into. We see this play out in political and social movements as well as in consumer marketing. Consider how Hindutva emerged and grew into a force over the last couple of decades in India. Although religious practices and ideas have always been a part of our social fabric, the airing of the Ramayana and Mahabharata serials on national TV helped to bring Hinduism and Hindu mythology into pop culture. The actors who played the main characters in those serials were able to run for and win elections. In this environment, it was easier for a political party to propagate the idea of Ram Rajya, a time &#8211; so the narrative goes &#8211; of peace and prosperity; an idyllic era before the foreign invasions began and one that we could and should bring back for the country.</p>
<p>The idea resonated with people because they were already consuming it as culture, as weekend family fare. The yearning for Ram Rajya existed at some level and was available to be leveraged and amplified. But it was an unexpressed and amorphous feeling until a group gave it voice and enabled a more hardline form of it to develop.</p>
<p>In essence, we buy into stories that align with our worldviews. The key to making something spread then is to find an existing worldview that has not been articulated. These worldviews may not always be harmless or desirable. Ram Rahim was able to play to the fears and anxieties of those on the fringe &#8211; people who felt shunned by mainstream religion &#8211; in order to build his Dera empire. Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a disenfranchised group of voters in order to win the 2016 US elections. In recent months, we have seen each of those narratives unraveling, to varying degrees, in chaos and violence.</p>
<p>Anticipating how something will play out is, of course, not that easy. Author and social commentator Santosh Desai once said: Insight is that which becomes retrospectively self-evident. In hindsight, we can clearly detect patterns, but they are harder to detect going in.</p>
<p>We can’t accurately gauge the impact of factors beyond the main narrative in shaping outcomes. Timing is another key factor. Take the story of Gandhi as an example. For the longest time, there was a level of myth making and a halo effect around this story. He was a man of principles, a crusader against untouchability, the leading beacon in the freedom movement. There was little room to examine his politics, let alone criticize them. It’s only more recently that we have acknowledged that he was human, with imperfect personal relationships and sometimes contradictory views. This has opened the door for more nuanced portraits of the Father of the Nation in books and movies.</p>
<p>On the consumer marketing side, the Fair &amp; Lovely narrative now has a counterpoint in Dove’s Real Beauty campaign. The idea that beauty doesn’t have to be narrowly defined by society or by cosmetics brands is a confident one that may not have taken off in the 80s or 90s. But over the last decade, Fair &amp; Lovely’s narrative had become so mainstream that it was time for a new one that would give voice to updated worldviews. Dove stepped in to fill that void.</p>
<p>The irony is that both Dove and Fair &amp; Lovely are Unilever brands. Two competing narratives. One parent company. Is that contradictory or inauthentic? Not necessarily as long as each brand remains committed to talking to consumers who connect with its worldview.</p>
<p>We create stories and buy into them and ultimately that’s what keeps the world and its ideas going around. At the core of it lie some very basic human needs &#8211; for love, security, identity and belonging.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Are there ethical issues involved in designing digital products to ‘hook’ the user? Although this may sound similar to ways of grabbing mindshare in other industries, technology is different because of how pervasive it is today. Do the solutions lie within the industry or outside it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, the digital experience of an aunt got me thinking about the pitfalls for those who wander in without sufficient orientation. She had no real interest in technology or social media until her daughter created a Facebook account for her. All was well until she discovered the online game of Farmville. Within weeks, what started out as mild curiosity in the game grew into full-blown addiction. Soon she began passing up social interactions so as not to lapse in tending to her goats or planting corn. While her digital farm was thriving, her offline life was not. Luckily for her, her family recognized the warning signs of digital overdose and were able to persuade her to cut back.</p>
<p>My aunt is another data point in the evidence building up in this area. Based on this evidence, psychiatrists and other mental health specialists now view digital addiction as a real disorder that is linked to other psychological ailments, including depression, anxiety and social withdrawal.</p>
<p>But is it any different from older and less scrutinized forms of technology addiction? There was a time several years ago when my uncle, growing up in a small town in Karnataka, got a transistor radio from his father. From the time it was passed onto him, my uncle was hooked &#8211; spending countless hours listening to music and commentary and even gathering his friends around him for a daily audio fix.</p>
<p>So then why are we so concerned about the effects of digital in our lives? Isn’t it just the modern equivalent of my uncle’s transistor?</p>
<p>Part of the reason we worry about technology today is because of how pervasive it is. We cannot realistically cut it out from our lives. We realize that some form of detox may be beneficial from time to time, but a complete disconnect is not realistic given that our productivity depends on staying connected. Our modern day lives, for better or for worse, are wedded to technology. According to one of many studies, the average person checks her phone 150 times a day, or every six minutes. It is no wonder that phones have been called the cigarettes of this era.</p>
<p>And this is not likely to change. That is because most, if not all digital products are built with a view to maximizing both the number of users as well as the time that each of them spends on the product. The goal, ultimately, is to snare the user in an endless loop of triggers and rewards. In a Silicon Valley bestseller called ‘Hooked’, author and entrepreneur Nir Eyal maps out the design process needed to build engaging products. As Eyal describes it, a mix of internal and external triggers can combine in a perfect storm that keeps drawing the user back into its eye.</p>
<p>Gamification is a big part of how many digital products &#8211; apps and platforms &#8211; are built today. It depends on adding whatever it takes &#8211; notifications, rewards, status &#8211; to drive user engagement and loyalty. And as companies continue to build data on individual usage patterns and behavior, they will be able to refine their strategies to make exiting harder and more costly for any given user.</p>
<p>This brings us to a key question: is this unacceptably manipulative? Design ethicists have argued that it is time for the technology industry to reflect on current strategies to see if and where they cross the line. Others believe that an externally developed and enforced code of ethics may be the solution.</p>
<p>Even in a book dedicated to building engaging (and potentially addictive) products, Nir Eyal does probe the ethical issues involved. He proposes a Manipulation Matrix as a way for technologists to assess how their products fare in terms of their influence on users and impact on society.</p>
<p>While this is a worthwhile debate, I am not convinced that the solutions proposed are entirely executable or sustainable.</p>
<p>We cannot depend on the technology industry to provide a path to digital balance. This is because, despite their best intentions, that is not who they are or what is encoded in their DNA. For them, reversing tracks or even slowing down will endanger them. And which business wants that? So, no matter what Zuckerberg says about saving the world or how committed Pichai may be to doing good, Facebook and Google still want more and more users spending more and more time on their platforms.</p>
<p>The answers, I believe, lie outside technology and with users. With greater awareness of the problem, users can assess their own digital habits and take steps to modify them where needed. For real awareness to set in, we have to start young and this is where schools come into the picture. Today’s parents are grappling with the right way to sensitize their children to the issue since they are still trying to understand all the implications and dangers of unrestricted usage. But the younger generation that is born into this digital-driven world will understand it more intuitively as long as schools provide the right orientation.</p>
<p>We should also look at forming groups or councils within cities and towns to disseminate information and build awareness around this issue. These could be comprised of mental health experts, educators as well as technologists who can provide recommendations and counseling based on the latest research in the area. This will enable people to come up with better and more effective ways to place limits &#8211; for themselves, their children and other vulnerable people in their circles.</p>
<p>At some level, we may be hardwired for addiction. And what we are seeing play out with technology is something we have seen in many other areas as well. For example, consider how Coke has tried to edge out &#8211; successfully in many cases &#8211; its prime competition of water and milk from the daily regimens of consumers. Under pressure, Coke has admitted that its sugar-laden drinks are not entirely good for people but that doesn’t stop it from trying to embed its name and logo in the larger public subconscious.</p>
<p>Technology is a double-edged sword. It offers a whole host of benefits to users &#8211; benefits that span information and learning, apart from entertainment. We can’t withdraw into a cave and forgo all of this. But we can take a step back from our phones every now and then. If we can also ignore its beep as we walk by, we may have finally figured out a way to beat its hold on us.</p>
