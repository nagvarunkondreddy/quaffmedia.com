				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="news-author">By Paarul Chand, PRmoment.in</p>
<p><em>This year marks 25 years for Lakshmanan in the PR business and 18 years of &#8216;The PRactice&#8217;. Nandita Lakshmanan shares her life story and lessons from her journey with PRmoment India </em></p>
<p>Imagine that you are a startup PR firm, at a time when the word startup didn&#8217;t have quite the same cache it does now. Imagine then pitching to an iconic IT firm and facing their storied set of founders across the table. With a total bench strength of 3 people in your company.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Nandita Lakshmanan, founder and chairperson of <a href="http://the-practice.net/about">The PRactice </a>ended up doing early on in her life as a PR entrepreneur. And if you haven&#8217;t guessed already that firm was Infosys, a pitch Lakshmanan and her team won in a 30-minute meeting.</p>
<p>This year marks 25 years for Lakshmanan in the PR business and 18 years of &#8216;The PRactice&#8217;. Lakshmanan shares her life story and lessons from her journey.</p>
<p><strong><span class="green-highlight">Early years at The PRactice :</span></strong></p>
<p>Nandita Lakshmanan says her foray into setting up her own firm was not planned. In October 1999, Lakshmanan started consulting after quitting Genesis. One of her first few clients was Acer, which had just broken away from Wipro. This opened the door to other mandates, including one with Grey Cell Technologies now called Unimobile. Lakshmanan was, therefore, able to ride the first wave of IT startups.</p>
<p>Lakshmanan says that while she worked with start-ups, it was always with caution.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="green-highlight">Commenting on the current rush for offering PR services for startups Lakshmanan says, &#8221; I am not enamoured with the start-ups. There is too much money being thrown about, there are huge marketing plans and not convincing business plans. I am hugely cautious,  I wanted to work with companies that would last, that have longevity.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="green-highlight">Pride in being a PR professional </span></strong></p>
<p>Nandita Lakshmanan says,  &#8220;We must not undermine the power of PR. We do have the power and can impact decision making at the very top. PR is the only function that takes a 360-degree view of the business. So go in with that kind of confidence. We are helping build a business, keep that in mind&#8221;</p>
<p>Lakshmanan adds that &#8221; I come from a family of journalists and I have always felt proud of being in PR. My first bosses were Prema Sagar and Archana Jain; when you see people like them hold their ground, it helps build your own self-awareness and confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lakshmanan also pointed out that while in PR a lot of emphasis is laid on relationships, it&#8217;s also important to remember that discipline and learning are also key to being successful at PR.</p>
<p><strong><span class="green-highlight">Letting go of active leadership at The PRactice </span></strong></p>
<p>In April 2014, in a rare move for founder-owners in the PR business in India, Lakshmanan handed over the reigns of &#8216;The PRactice&#8217;, to current CEO, Vivek Rana.</p>
<p>Lakshmanan says rather wryly that it was a mid-life crisis that led to the decision. She says, &#8221; All my senior leadership team members at that time, were 10 to 12 years in the firm and it is good to make way for the next phase in life. It was time for them to experience being at the helm.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="green-highlight">&#8220;To show outcomes for digital needed a younger leadership team. I do keep myself abreast, but I have a team that was passionate about the digital challenge.  I would be limiting the organisation if I would continue to stay. There was a need for me to do something different.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="green-highlight">On Infosys</span></strong></p>
<p>The PRactice continued to handle the Infosys mandate for 12 years, but not during the 2016 clash between the promoter and CEO. Sharing her reaction to the very public battle, Lakshmanan says, &#8220;It pained me a lot to see what was happening, these people are the architects of corporate India. It was distressing to see how opinion was overlaid over the developments. In the age of perception and fake news, it has to be taken with a lot of scepticism.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="green-highlight">Lakshmanan adds that &#8221; Infosys is a company that is built on very strong values and unless it was shaken, it wouldn&#8217;t have come to this. We all live in glass houses. We have to be very careful about how we behave.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>As we wrap the interview, Lakshmanan shares her business philosophy. She says I believe that &#8220;Topline is vanity, cash flow is reality and the bottom line is sanity!&#8221; Lakshmanan says they have never resorted to borrowings and have always been profitable.&#8221; She says, &#8220;The size of our office doesn&#8217;t matter to us, our values and growth does.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Christina Moniz, IMPACT</p>
<blockquote><p><em>With rapid growth of Digital and Social media, and changing media consumption pattern of millennial consumers, the PR industry needs to diversify and realign its services, become strategic partners for marketers and deliver direct impact on the business of brands to reach the projected growth for 2020</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Public Relations (PR) industry in India has shown substantial growth over the years, as much as 18% in the last year alone, according to a survey report released by the Public Relations Consultants Association of India (PRCAI). Valued at Rs 1,315 crore in FY17, up from Rs 1,120 crore last year, the industry is projected to grow to a value of Rs 2,000 crore by 2020. But with the dramatic way in which brand communications are driven today, how well equipped is the PR industry to meet that number? In the age of real-time communication and with the rapid pace of Social Media, brands will be looking at PR to do more than they ever have. PR leaders and stalwarts share their insights into what the industry must do to evolve in order to meet the changing communication needs of brands today.</p>
<p><b>ADVANTAGE NEW AGE MEDIA</b></p>
<p><b>Dilip Cherian, Group Managing Director, Perfect Relations Group</b>, believes the PR industry must shift emphasis from traditional media communications to creating more niche experiences for consumers. “Conventional marketing spends are not working the way they used to. So the PR industry today needs to use tools that offer two-way engagement with customers. The shift towards Digital PR is a result of this pressure. The other significant change is that the industry is no longer designing mega events to offer large scale engagement with consumers, but creating more niche experiences where messaging is targeted at smaller, focused groups of people. We are shifting the emphasis from traditional media tools to communication in product, publications and on platforms like YouTube,” he says.</p>
<p>The PR professional must earn consumer attention instead of demanding or paying for it, according to <strong>Himanshu Saxena</strong>, Brand Lead, Edelman India. “With the advent of social media, people are willing to talk to strangers instead of the brand they have known for 30 years. Over 50% of consumers in India are making their purchase decisions based on the social influences around them instead of brand messaging. PR agencies need to now deliver direct impact on a brand’s business. You can no longer feel satisfied with the depth of engagement and likes.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4076" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Image-1.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="419" /></p>
<p><strong>Siddharth Banerjee, Executive Vice-President, Marketing, Vodafone India</strong>, believes it is necessary to have a strong synergy between marketing and PR with the growing importance of newage media. “PR has played a critical role in enhancing Vodafone’s brand recall and reinforcing its commitment especially as the Indian Telecom sector navigates through a hyper-competitive phase. Working closely with the PR team has helped us garner meaningful mindshare for key marketing campaigns like Vodafone’s IPL efforts, the #LookUp movement, The Data Strong Network campaign et al. Traditional mediums like Print and TV are seeing slower growth while the mobile phone is becoming the preferred choice to bridge the content divide. The digital consumer is now accessing content on-the-go, especially in regional languages.”</p>
<p>Storytelling will continue to remain the pivotal element in the PR practice, says <strong>Prema Sagar, Vice Chair, Burson-Marsteller, Asia Pacific &amp; Principal/Founder, Genesis Burson-Marsteller</strong>. “Visual story-telling, increased influencer engagement &#8211; online and offline -as well as the use of co-created content is on the rise. Today ‘listicles’, short nuggets of stories, or snackable news, is the way to go and PR will have to play a pivotal role in creating communication strategies to suit this need. In short, the combined power of data analytics, creativity in thinking, content and design, visual story telling and innovative and swift delivery of the message will be the arsenal that PR consultancies will need,” she states. <strong>Valerie Pinto, CEO, Weber Shandwick</strong>, concurs, adding that PR agencies will need to build on their storytelling capabilities and apply them to new age media. “Platforms like Buzzfeed and Scroll have been very effective. The younger people in our teams find this far more appealing than traditional PR. Today, everything is a playing field. You can apply PR to every division in an organization, but it’s how you approach that pitch, how you build brand purpose and achieve talkability across platforms,” she explains.</p>
<p><strong>A CHANNEL AGNOSTIC APPROACH</strong></p>
<p>While the tools and platforms available to PR agencies are plenty, brands require agencies to align their strategies with their overall purpose. PR agencies will need to now leverage their story-telling capabilities across various platforms. <strong>Chetan Mahajan, CEO &amp; President, Hill + Knowlton Strategies India</strong>, maintains that the PR industry must continue to leverage its story-telling proficiency, irrespective of the channel. “In the past, we would restrict our stories to the earned space but now we have built and we continue to build our skills and use other channels including paid, owned and shared channels.</p>
<p>For the industry to stay relevant and attract larger budgets from brands, we need to enhance our content capabilities and deliver stories in a channel agnostic fashion. For instance, if it’s about thought leadership, why not use LinkedIn in addition to the conventional, traditional Press?” he says. <strong>Sonia Huria, Head, Communications &amp; CSR, Viacom18</strong>, adds that mass communication must now be replaced with a focused approach. “The days of carpet bombing are over! Whether social or traditional media, campaigns today are completely based on targeted audience segmentation. The availability of data and tech tools that help monitor, analyse and interpret data across platforms are increasingly shaping communication strategies, seamlessly synchronizing offline and online parts of a campaign. The RoI for communication is now no longer measured in terms of just size but rather a whole host of parameters such as placement and reach.”</p>
<p>The narrative now will be a collaborative one, featuring both traditional and new-age media, says <strong>Kunal Kishore Sinha, Founder &amp; Director, Value 360 Communications</strong>. “The lines between PR firms and Digital firms are going to blur and I see my agency more as a communications firm. Our strategy for clients will need to seamlessly weave the narrative across channels. The ‘paid’ element will also come into play and that will add to the revenues of the PR firm. However, unlike advertising, the PR agency must now look at strategically using the paid space and make it appear more like an earned space,” Sinha says.</p>
<p><strong>Communications consultant Anup Sharma </strong>opines that the concern of credibility is what will make the role of influencers very important in the future. “The blurring line between paid and earned media creates the issue of credibility and trust in communication, leading to the growing importance of influencers who are now being used to drive engagement. To continue to stay relevant, PR firms will also need to rely on big data and artificial intelligence not only for predicting audience interests but also to move the needle towards credible engagement,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>SO, HAS THE PR RETAINER INCREASED?</strong></p>
<p>In the past, PR agencies typically have had to contend with the smallest share in the marketing pie, but that is slowly changing, though agency heads believe that there is a long way to go before the PR industry gets sizeable increase in retainer fees. <strong>Paresh Chaudhry, CEO, Madison PR </strong>explains, “About 20 years ago, as much as 95% of the marketing budget was allocated to advertising, while the rest was BTL or something else. PR would get about 1% or 2% of the budget, but we have made some progress since then. Today, about 70% is allocated to advertising, sometimes even 65%. For example, Hindustan Unilever’s ad spends have reduced considerably from 95% to 62%. I spent many years with the organization, so I know that. A good percentage is now going to Digital. So if PR got about 2% of the budget 20 years ago, it had perhaps moved up to 3% a decade ago. Now, it is at about 5% for very large companies, while mid-sized companies may spend as much as 10%. Start-ups only use PR and do not advertise much, so that’s a new sector where the industry can grow.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4077" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Image-2.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="1004" /></p>
<p>There is still an uphill task in convincing brands to invest more in PR, but they are now recognizing that its ability to modulate its message to what is in the news works very well. Cherian explains, “Marketers are looking to us to harness the benefit of something new happening in the environment. Also, PR is able to respond much faster than a traditional media campaign. By the time you shoot a commercial or put together an advertising campaign, that specific mood or trend has passed. This gives the PR industry an opportunity to harvest opportunities and thereby get an increased budget from the marketing pie.”</p>
<p><strong>Paroma Roy Chowdhury, VP, Corporate Communications &amp; Public Affairs, Soft Bank Group</strong>, insists that mere functional excellence is not enough for PR agencies to get a larger share of the pie. Brands are looking at PR partners to make an impact on their businesses. “Brands are looking at increasing their budgets for PR, but it would entirely depend on how much credibility and value that the PR partners &#8211; both internal and external &#8211; bring to the table. To get a larger share of budgets and attention, you need to be a business stakeholder and partner and drive outcome that affects the business positively. Mere functional excellence does not do it, though that by itself, is very important,” she says.</p>
<p><strong>Vivek Rana, CEO, The PRactice</strong>, points out that while PR budgets may have increased, revenues haven’t necessarily increased. “Agencies may be getting bigger budgets or retainers but a large chunk of that is often allocated to paid media space or coverage. So perhaps out of a Rs 20 lakh retainer, you may be spending as much as Rs 18 lakh on paid exposure, in which case your revenues are not really increasing. I would, therefore, not use retainers as a benchmark. If you’re actually able to widen the scope of what you’re doing and thereby, get higher budgets allocated to PR, that may actually impact your revenue overall. That is what we are doing now at The Practice,” Rana adds. Pinto explains that the few brands that do not advertise heavily tend to invest more in PR. “Brands such as Mattel, Disney and Apple do a few hoardings and Social Media advertising and no TV, so they are able to devote a larger share of their budget to PR. I did a bit of an experiment with my consumer vertical team that has worked very well. The team’s target was to get me twice the revenue from the same client. So from the base retainer, we offered our existing clients Social Media and a bit of Digital and influencer engagement. We have grown 59% in the last one year just because we were able to build on our capabilities with the new age media. A brand will definitely look at giving you a larger retainer if you can widen the scope of what you do. But if you restrict your scope of work to something specific like media relations, then brands will determine your remuneration accordingly.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4078" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Image-3.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="1004" /></p>
<p><strong>Lokesh Kataria, Head Marketing, Mattel India</strong>, tells us that his PR spends have increased over the past year. “With regard to PR, we were not up to the mark until a few years ago, but we have geared up now. If our spends during 2015-16 were between 0-5% of the marketing budget, we have now upped them to somewhere between 15% to 25%. This includes offline and online, PR, influencer engagement, KOL and media. Our mandate to our PR partners is very clear – we want to engage with the millennial parents. So whether they read a magazine or the Navbharat Times or if they are on the First Moms Club or Kids Stop Press, there is a whole wide universe that impacts them. For us, PR is no more about just getting exposure in a publication. It is now about getting impressions in a Digital and Social world. Our PR agency’s mandate is to achieve a higher positive emotion and create greater customer loyalty.”</p>
<p><strong>Veetika Deoras, Chief Operating Officer, Digital Vertical &amp; VP, Brand Marketing, Tata Capital</strong>, explains that the brand takes a holistic view of PR encompassing online and offline channels, and says, “Across Print, electronic, voice, Digital and social media, PR helps get genuine and relevant stories to our target audiences and increases the visibility of our products and other initiatives. We endeavour to stand out by crafting standalone and integrated stories that emanate from our overall brand and communication strategy. Broadly, around 10% to 15% of our budget goes towards PR across offline and online channels.”</p>
<p>Apart from looking at increasing retainers and revenue, most PR firms are also mindful about not taking on business that pays anything less than their stipulated minimum retainer fee. <strong>Archana Jain, Managing Director, PR Pundit</strong>, elaborates, “If it is not profitable for us, we do not take on an account. Having said that, all of us in the industry flout the minimum retainer rule from time to time. There could be several reasons – it may be a marquee brand that we want to get on board, or it could be a new segment where we see a great opportunity to build ourselves as a firm. I recall that some years ago, we took on a luxury brand for a retainer and we were not making much money on it. But because of that brand, we were able to go out and win ten new accounts that helped us make the money we were losing off that account. So we have to be judicious in making decisions with new accounts.”</p>
<p><strong>WINNING THE BOARDROOM’S PATRONAGE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nitin Mantri, CEO, Avian Media </strong>and President of the PRCAI, is of the opinion that PR needs to look at the boardroom, and not just marketers, for bigger budgets. “If we are to look at a sizeable jump in budget, PR firms should be working more with C-level executives than with marketing heads. From a reputation perspective, CEOs are becoming more wary of the right corporate reputation. Our clients are still Corporate Communication heads and therein lies the problem.” Rana agrees, adding that the PRmandate will have to evolve into a strong management discipline reporting directly into the boardroom. “PR will have to supersede communication and marketing, and to be really successful, it will need the direct patronage of the board.”</p>
<p>Streamlining measurement systems for a better understanding of ROI is one step the industry can work towards to get organizations to devote a greater budget to PR. <strong>Jaideep Shergill, Founding Partner, Pitchfork Partners</strong>, says, “There are some measurement systems in place but these are not enough and they are not even used consistently. For the PR industry to stay in the game and be relevant, we need to step up and offer services beyond core functions. There’s a whole lot that can be done in the space of internal communications, talent branding, CSR and shareholder communication. These are areas that no other industry can meet. There are enough opportunities that we need to recognize and capitalize on.”</p>
<p><strong>Jishnu Sen, CMO, Future Retail </strong>opines that the role of PR can definitely go beyond just working with marketing teams, especially for companies that are positioning themselves as market leaders.“For an organization to be viewed at thought leaders or market leaders, we need a qualified team that can connect our customers to us and keep them rightly informed. Though PR professionals possess the functional agility to work hand-inglove with marketing think-tanks, they are an independent unit that holds immense capacity to maintain and move public opinion, for the business as a whole,” Sen says.</p>
<p>Deoras points out that choosing the right PR partner across channels is critical. “A good PR partner ensures that they understand the business and brand values, the nuances of the industry, are competent across channels and are able to pre-empt and manage crises, among other things. While the ultimate goal of all communication is to generate awareness and sales, PR focuses on generating goodwill and credibility which is extremely valuable for any company and brand.”</p>

<p><strong>WHAT LIES AHEAD</strong></p>
<p>The industry may have grown significantly from where it was five years ago, but it is still playing catch-up with the way PR has grown in other markets such as China. <strong>Amit Misra, CEO, MSLGroup</strong>, points out, “For the same resource deployment and the same services, China still earns remuneration that is about five times more than we do. That being said, I think they have been able to demonstrate more value and extract better premium for their services, which is something we need to work towards. I think there are enough people willing to pay more towards PR but what we need to do is add more value to our clients. Agencies that are able to add specializations are sitting in a very healthy position.” There are a few things that have impacted the industry positively, he adds.</p>
<p>“Clients now have an approach of strategic thinking where PR is concerned and that is very welcome. Another positive change is talent. Today we have youngsters coming in from esteemed institutions like the London School of Economics with an undergraduate course in mass communications.</p>
<p>They are looking at career options in communications, something you wouldn’t have seen a decade ago. This augurs very well for the industry.” Vodafone’s Banerjee maintains that the role of PR will become fundamental with growing digital disruptions. As more Indians start connecting to the mobile Internet, PR programmes will need to adopt a different approach to engage with ‘hyperlocal’ or ‘regional’ influencers, he says, adding, “This becomes even more critical in the era of fake news and other digital disruptions. We have opened up a state-ofthe- art Social Media Command Centre a few quarters ago at Vodafone which also helps provide real-time inputs to PR actions.”</p>
<p><strong>Rakesh Thukral, Managing Director, Edelman India</strong>, maintains that engagement will remain the core of the PR profession, though there are newer layers and degrees of engagement. The PR industry must look at diverse skillsets when recruiting. The new-age PR agency will, therefore, have more than just PR professionals. “We are taking in people from the strategy and planning world and are hiring content creators, editorial writers and copy writers.</p>
<p>Out of our 400 plus people, over 25% are from creative, audio-visual, digital and strategy backgrounds. While doing this, we ensure that we do not give up on our top notch execution from a core PR point of view. We practice our work in a unique way that deploys PR as the lead force while also pushing through the integrated marketing mix.” Mantri concurs, adding that PR must now look at designing and running end-to-end campaigns. “Today, I can’t tell the client to run a campaign and limit my role to getting a few Print coverage clips. Instead, I will have to run the entire campaign, shoot the videos, design creative collateral and run them on social media. We now have to build the campaign and also get earned media on top of that.” <strong>Udit Pathak, Co-founder and Director, Media Mantra</strong>, adds, “Today, PR firms should focus on hiring Chief Creative Officers instead of Chief Executive Officers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4080" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Image-5.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="440" /></p>
<p>Alongside, they need to redefine practices to ensure more creativity clubbed with customized solutions under one umbrella. This not only brings more value to the mandate but also assists in getting bigger clients with the desired inflow of money.”</p>
<p>Huria believes the key to effective PR lies in team work between brand and agency. “Having worked in an agency before transitioning into the corporate side, I strongly believe that the PR agency needs to be an extension of the in-house team. Once this is established in principle, the two teams, together, need to identify their strengths and weaknesses and identify how they can complement one another,” she says. At Madison PR, Chaudhry encourages his team to take on the role of a brand manager. This, he believes, will ensure that brands recognize the value of PR and look at granting larger budgets. “For a lot of our top brands like Asian Paints, Café Coffee Day, P&amp;G and Abbott, our teams are now starting to think from a marketing perspective. They understand positioning, marketing mixes and trade insights, and are definitely adding value on that front. As an industry, we need to pay greater attention to this, and become more than just an agency to the brands we service.”</p>
<p>Prema Sagar adds that in addition to stepping into a marketer’s role, a PR professional must also bear in mind the brand’s business objectives. “In every campaign, there has to be creativity and a clear roadmap that charts the role of PR from thinking to planning and then to execution. In that, we have to assign utmost importance to the measurement of deliverables that can be linked back to the business objectives, whether used in isolation or as part of an integrated communications outreach. There is definitely a wider understanding of the value of PR among Indian businesses, but we have to work together as an industry to continuously demonstrate and communicate this value,” Sagar asserts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Parul Chand, PRMoment</p>
<p>Most urban working Indians ( unless you have been living under the proverbial rock!) have an opinion on Infosys and the Tata Group. Which is why, the very public founder/promoter &#8211; CEO spats were such a shock to the public. It went against the values of trust, reliability, efficiency and ethics that both companies stood for, its&#8217; brand purpose.</p>
<p>In today’s business environment, where reputations can be built and torn down in a 24-hour social media cycle, brand purpose is what can define a company’s long term image in a crisis. And it’s easy too take the eye off the ball.</p>
<p>This misstep by Dove this week, showed just how vigilant and sustained brand purpose must be. Dove has since apologised and pulled the ad that missed the mark in showcasing Dove’s brand purpose of #RealBeauty.</p>
<p><strong>For Indian companies, is brand purpose still poorly defined?</strong></p>
<p>Arijit Sengupta, vice president &#8211; public advocacy, <a href="http://the-practice.net/">The PRactice</a> points out that, “ ‘Brand purpose’ is often correctly reflected in the life time value (LTV) of the brand. The LTV of a brand cannot simply be purchased or force fed by way of mass media. It is an organic process that needs careful and nuanced consideration over a significant amount of time.Marketers today are confusing intense media led narratives (read as noise!) as the bedrock of brand purpose.”</p>
<p>Sengupta cautions that to see brand purpose as a quick process is a mistake.</p>
<p>He clarifies saying, “Typically Indian companies are not great repositories of brand purpose, barring a handful. The approach for most Indian companies have been sales led and functional. There has been a genuine lack of continuing narratives for most Indian brands and this has hurt us in the global context. And the results are there for all to see. No Indian brand features in the worlds’ most recognisable brand list. We are probably the only large country with large companies who don’t have a truly global brand. “</p>
<p>Adds Sengupta, “The problem area from a personal understanding is that of frequent changes in the life story of the brand. Even the two most successful and recognisable global Indian brands (Amul and Air India) have gaps where they have radically altered the purpose or ethos of what they stand for.  “</p>
<p>However, in the brave new world where the art of ‘pivot’ is celebrated, identifying and celebrating brand purpose is tough.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Brand Purpose </strong>| <em>Arijit Sengupta</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Coke –</strong> “Open Happiness” – Coca Cola narrative has been unchanged for the last 100 years.</em><br />
<em> <strong>BMW –</strong> “Joy” and “Ultimate Driving Machine” – When you think of a “drivers car’ – you think BMW. They make cars that are for pure driving pleasure. Most people own a Toyota – but dream of a BMW.</em><br />
<em> <strong>Apple –</strong> “Think different.”</em></p>
<p>He clarifies saying, “Typically Indian companies are not great repositories of brand purpose, barring a handful. The approach for most Indian companies have been sales led and functional. There has been a genuine lack of continuing narratives for most Indian brands and this has hurt us in the global context. And the results are there for all to see. No Indian brand features in the worlds’ most recognisable brand list. We are probably the only large country with large companies who don’t have a truly global brand. “</p>
<p>Adds Sengupta, “The problem area from a personal understanding is that of frequent changes in the life story of the brand. Even the two most successful and recognisable global Indian brands (Amul and Air India) have gaps where they have radically altered the purpose or ethos of what they stand for.  “</p>
<p>However, in the brave new world where the art of ‘pivot’ is celebrated, identifying and celebrating brand purpose is tough.</p>
<p><strong>The CSR effect</strong></p>
<p>The Companies Act 2013, laid down a criterion for a 2 percent spend on CSR linked to levels of turnover and net worth. This made India the first country in the world to make CSR mandatory.</p>
<p>While this has provided a framework to direct social activities, it has also led to a poorer understanding of how to achieve brand purpose.</p>
<p>Girish Balachandran, founder <a href="http://www.onpurposeconsulting.in/">&#8216;On Purpose&#8217;</a> who has done work around communication  or childhood obesity for ‘Sesame Workshop India&#8217;  points out that, “ CSR is largely a compliance led activity, with lots of meaningless photo-opportunities, award exercises and a new industry for impact measurement and reporting. The minute we equate CSR with brand purpose, we&#8217;re already diluting a brand. It then becomes a function, along with other support ones, with a functional head and a title, with little or no real influence on the business model or a reason for innovation and growth.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4054 aligncenter" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brand-speech.png" alt="" width="574" height="336" /></p>
<p>Himanshu Saxena, brand lead, <a href="http://www.edelman.in/">Edelman India</a> “Ironically though, the consumer desire to buy or boycott brands whose social purpose resonates with the communities has reached an all-time high — as evidenced in ‘<a href="https://www.edelman.com/earned-brand/">Edelman Earned Brand Study 2017</a>’. So, far from being abused, the idea of brand &amp; business actions based on solid purpose is still highly under-leveraged in India for not just winning long-term consumer commitment but also building an unfair advantage for brands.”</p>
<p>S Roy Kandpal, vice-president, <a href="http://www.adfactorspr.com/">Adfactors PR</a>, agrees that brand purpose is in danger of becoming the latest buzz word without reaching its proper potential as a long term and best expression of a brand.</p>
<p>Says Kandpal, “One can&#8217;t help but think that brand purpose is being proposed as an answer to rising distrust of over inflated brand promise and advertising. Brand purpose has become the ‘Purple Cow’ ( with reference to Seth  Godin’s book on transforming business)  of marketers and advertisers.”</p>
<p><strong>How to frame purpose led communications</strong></p>
<p>Weber Shandwick’s recent report  on ‘<a href="http://webershandwick.asia/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WS-InclusiveGlobalEconomies.pdf">Inclusive Global Economies’i</a>dentifies a step by step process on planning purpose led communications:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Munira Rangwala, YourStory</p>
<p>The relationship between PR professionals and the media has always been idiosyncratic in nature. While they love to hate each other, the two professions are heavily reliant on each other to survive in the professional ecosystem. So we can’t lay enough importance on the job that aspiring PR professionals have in hand. While its expected of PR professionals to make a journalist’s work and life immeasurably better, there are quite a few who badger scribes with constant press releases and phone calls.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3916" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/YourStory-620x310.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="310" /></p>
<p>A good PR official is someone who understands the news and works to uncover and push important stories of their companies. They handle investigations and difficult questions with honesty and they have proven themselves to be good partners to journalists.</p>
<div class="article-information">
<div class="clearfix article-para ys_post_content">
<p>Role models to all professionals aspiring to make their mark in PR, here are five PR veterans who are on top of their communications game.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Nandita Lakshmanan – Founder and Chairman, The PRactice</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The PRactice has grown to become one of the country’s premier independent PR consultancies, since establishment in the year 2000. The company is particularly well-known for representing its technology and consumer clients pan-India. Nandita Lakshmanan took PRactice international through its alliance with Porter Novelli. Since then, under her able <a href="https://yourstory.com/2016/10/leadership-lessons-bill-gates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leadership</a>, the company has won numerous international awards and continues to do so.</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>

He specializes in communication strategy for startups and online ventures.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Amit Misra – Managing Director, MSLGROUP</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amit Misra leads MSLGROUP India and under his leadership the firm has won the ‘Great Place to Work’ survey for the second time in a row. His <a href="https://yourstory.com/2017/02/career-mistakes-to-avoid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career</a> boasts of an extensive experience including roles of public affairs and corporate consulting advisory to multinational business conglomerates across India as well as Asia. Amit Misra’s wide portfolio boasts of him being the MD of Zeno Group, Director of APCO Worldwide and Vice-President at Hanmer &amp; Partners before he was nicked by the MSLGROUP.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Archana Jain – Founder and MD, PR PUNDIT</strong></h2>

Practicing PR since 1990, Archana Jain continues to steer the company to offer a value proposition of efficiency, <a href="https://yourstory.com/2017/02/hacking-creativity-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creativity</a> and innovation.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Amith Prabhu, Reputationtoday.in</p>
<p>There are two lists one refers to in order to get an idea of the notable Public Relation firms present in India. There are two types of firms based on ownership. First, those that are international and most of them feature in the Top 30 in the Holmes Report list. These include the following – Edelman, Weber Shandwick, Fleishman, Ketchum Sampark, MSLGROUP, Genesis BM, H+K Strategies, Ogilvy PR, Golinopinion, Brunswick, Cohn &amp; Wolfe Six Degrees, FTI Consulting, APCO Worldwide, WE Communications, Ruder Finn, Text 100, Zeno Group, Lewis and Dentsu through Perfect Relations. These are about 19 firms out of which 14 are PRCAI members, just for the record.</p>
<p>The second source for a list is the PRCAI website where member firms are listed and the Top 10 among the Indian firms are Adfactors (which is in a different league), Avian Media, Value 360, The PRactice, PR Pundit, Integral, Aim High Consulting and Madison. Golinopinion and Astrum would be in this list but are not PRCAI members.</p>
<p>Then there are numerous smaller firms that are raring to go, of which some are waiting to be folded into larger firms. A dozen among them I will list down in a subsequent paragraph. This column highlights a dozen firms in the Top 25 that do not have a direct India presence including Blue Focus from China, Havas from France, W20 Group from the US, MC Group from Germany, Sunny Side Up from Japan, Porter Novelli which has an affiliation but no other presence, Huntsworth Health, Finsbury, Vector Inc and Inventiv Health which means they would look at being part of an exciting market through an acquisition or through starting out on their own like four others did in the last decade and have not made the kind of inroads that the firms have made who entered the inorganic way.</p>
<p>Ruderfinn, WE Communications, APCO Worldwide and Fleishman entered in the last decade on their own and have remained largely boutique. Text 100 is the only firm that came in on its own and has been among the Top 10 firms. It started here in the mid-90s and has been consistent. Compared to those that set-up shop on their own, firms such as Burson Marsteller, MSLGROUP, Edelman, Weber Shandwick, Ketchum and Cohn &amp; Wolfe which entered through acquisitions have grown rapidly.</p>
<p>There is a wave of firms ranging from Gutenberg, Media Mantra, Kaizzen, Boring Brands, Fuzion, Wordswork, First Partners, Quikrelations, Candour, Simulations and PR Hub among others that are in the sub $2million range.</p>
<p>All this brings me to the point that I like reminding myself that the Top 5 firms together have a turnover of INR 450 crore. The next five are at about INR 100 crore. The next 10 at about INR 150 crore. These comprise 60% of the organised PR consulting business. The next 30 firms are in the INR 6 to 9 crore range followed by another 50+ firms in the INR 3 to 6 crore range. This is in comparison with the advertising business in India which is worth INR 63,000 crore or $100 million. Another way to look at it is that the entire PR consulting business in India is smaller than the total revenue of the Top 2 firms globally. These figures are to put a perspective and let existing firms know that there is a lot more potential in the second-tier companies and second-tier cities waiting to be tapped.</p>

<p><strong>Vignesh Nair, Corporate &amp; Government Affairs, Mondelez India</strong><br />
<strong>Dream Job Factor: A work day that involves chocolate! Enough said.</strong></p>

<p>Says Nair, “Whenever I passed by Cadbury House in South Mumbai, when I was young, I always thought how awesome it would be to work for a chocolate company. Working for a company with such a strong legacy and who makes some of India&#8217;s favourite food brands like ‘Cadbury Dairy Milk’ is indeed a dream come true for me.”</p>
<p><strong>Radhika Mehta, </strong><strong>p</strong><strong>artner </strong><strong>associate &#8211; Brands, Sports &amp; Entertainment, Genesis Burson-Marsteller</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dream Job Factor: Sidharth Malhotra! Sidharth Malhotra! Sidharth Malhotra!</strong></p>

<blockquote><p><em>Radhika Mehta with Bollywood actor Sidharth Malhotra</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Says Mehta, “During my trip with Sidharth Malhotra to New Zealand, I got the opportunity to meet several influencers like the New Zealand Prime Minister, New Zealand cricket legends like Stephen Fleming and be an active contributor to the formulation for the Indian campaign.”</p>
<p><strong>Karl Webster</strong><strong>, cluster director of PR and communications at Anantara Resorts and Spas,The Maldives</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dream Job Factor: Working largely speaking on a sandbank sort of makes it different to everything and anything</strong></p>
<p>Karl Webster was headhunted through international recruiters for this job that involves looking after four five- and six-star properties.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3784" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Karl-480x400.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="400" /></p>
<p>Says Webster, “ Working in what is effectively paradise on a day-to-day basis speaks for itself. I wake-up to the sun and it is the same at the end of the day, everyday. Being an international company requires travel to key feeder markers, which I really enjoy. I also feel that what I am doing makes a difference to the brand. Finally, I&#8217;m working in a new cultural environment meeting new and diverse people, something I thrive on.”</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Bareh, Senior Consulting Associate </strong><strong>– </strong><strong>Brands, Sports &amp; Entertainment, Genesis Burson-Marsteller</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dream Job factor: Sports and more sports!</strong></p>
<p>Andrew Bareh spends his day helping to promote sports stars across various games. Bareh helped, for instance, to launch the first ‘Women Kabaddi Championship’ in India.</p>
<p>Say Bareh, “The dynamic nature of sports PR is what makes me look forward to every day.</p>
<p>The fact that very few people get to work alongside football legends, Kabaddi champions, cricket legends or polo players is a great opportunity.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3785" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Andrew-480x400.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="400" /></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Andrew Bareh with Welsh footballer and coach Ryan Joseph Giggs, who also co-owns Salford City football club</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sports PR also gets you up close and personal with the nuances of the game; giving one a chance to appreciate and be a subject matter expert on it.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Tanvi Dubey, YourStory</p>
<p><em>Four women show how the public relations industry has complemented the startup boom in the country.</em></p>
<p>A public relations (PR) firm or company plays an essential role in creating brand value for a company. With evolved and far-reaching plans, an effective PR campaign can help a company communicate its ideas, reach more clients, and increase sales.</p>
<p>According to a report by Public Relations Consultants Association of India, the <a href="https://yourstory.com/2016/07/pr-tips-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PR industry</a> is expected to touch Rs 2,100 crore in market size by fiscal 2020. The survey conducted among 42 companies in India shows that the industry doubled in size, from Rs 490 crore in the fiscal year 2008 to Rs 1,120 crore in the fiscal year in 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world of public relations has evolved. We have never had a social, economic and political environment that is more dynamic, volatile and complex than what we have today; the market realities of the 21st century will ensure public relations thrives and becomes a management discipline&#8221;, says Nandita Lakshmanan, founder of The PRactice.</p>
<p>How has the industry grown and transformed over the years? Has technology disrupted this industry? We spoke to four women who have been successfully running <a href="https://yourstory.com/2015/03/pr-agencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PR firms</a> and seen this industry undergo change.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3587" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nandita-620x310.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="310" /></p>
<h2><strong>Nandita Lakshmanan — The PRactice</strong></h2>
<p>Nandita started The PRactice in 2000 at the age of 30 with just Rs 35,000. Today, she has 100 employees. This Delhi-born-and-bred entrepreneur started her career in 1993 with Genesis Burson-Marsteller (then Genesis PR). “When word got around I was no longer with the firm I was working with, people came forward to ask me for counsel and to work for them. At some point, I knew I had enough well-wishers and with a slight nudge from my then husband started The PRactice.”</p>
<h2><strong>Suhasini Ahluwalia Mehta — Stellant Communications</strong></h2>
<p>Suhasini Ahluwalia Mehta, founder of Stellant Communications, is a thoroughbred Mumbai girl. She did her schooling from Loreto Convent at Chembur and graduated in Microbiology. Suhasini holds an MBA in Marketing Management from Xavier Institute of Management in Mumbai.</p>
<p>She worked with Pritish Nandy when he was just starting out on his own. “I supported him in a variety of interesting endeavours – politics, research, TV production, setting up the first cyber café with Leela Kempinski, and his efforts of getting virtual reality outlets into the country etc. I learned a lot there and used to interact with different personalities — achievers and celebrities from all walks of life,” she says.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3588" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/suhasini-mehta-620x310.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="310" /></p>
<p>Her curiosity about PR led her to the industry. She started by making a list of PR agencies, called the first one and landed a job. However, an unsatisfactory job stint led her to freelance. Her efforts were noticed and eventually, it led her to start her own boutique firm in 2005.</p>
<p>Stellant Communications has partnered with entrepreneurs to help them with image and risk management. “We have had the good fortune of working with most of them on a long-term basis,” says Suhasini.</p>
<div class="s-holder">
<h2><strong>Tejasvi and Purvi — ARKA Communications</strong></h2>
<p>Purvi Shetty (31) and Tejasvi Murthy (29), are true-blue Bangaloreans and have been in the PR industry for a little over a decade.</p>
<p>Tejasvi started her stint with PR at Red Communications. “I’ve been telling stories for as long as I can remember, public relations called to me,” she shares. Purvi started her career with brand communications. “In fact, Tejasvi and I met each other while working at brand comm. A keen interest in brands and marketing led me to PR,” she explains. With a passion for building creative communications strategies for SMEs coupled with Bengaluru’s growing startup ecosystem led them to start ARKA in 2015.</p>
<p>“&#8217;Arka&#8217; in Sanskrit means the Sun. And it is a fitting name, for here, as we believe in transforming every story into magic with just a little bit of sensibility and a whole lot of sunshine,” share the women.</p>
<p>Tejasvi and Purvi work across all sectors. “Whatever the story may be, we are here to give our clients personal attention and craft a narrative, tailor-made to suit their needs,” they say. They currently have on their list startups, SMEs, individuals and even the government.</p>
<p>Working with the government gives them an opportunity to see things from close quarters. They get to see a diverse set of people and perspectives, and everyday is a new learning.</p>
<p>“We have had the opportunity to meet and work with a number of government officials, some of whom were among the most hard working, efficient, and driven people we have ever met. The ability to think on your feet quickly and spontaneously is extremely important while working with the government,” they quip.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3589" src="http://the-practice.net/wpr/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Purvi-and-Tejasvi-620x310.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="310" /></p>
<h2><strong>Challenges within the industry</strong></h2>
<p>Though the industry is women-dominated and women-friendly, it still takes a lot of skills to survive in this industry. Nandita shares, “My female colleagues and counterparts work an average of ten hours a day, and it can go up to fourteen-fifteen hours, maybe longer when the occasion demands; deadlines are tough, our stakeholders are demanding and life is as exciting and challenging as any other business in the services sector. Add to that it is a knowledge industry and we have to stay ahead of our clients. So, yes, I would urge other industries to take a leaf from the public relations industry to see what we have done right to create a work environment that allows women to thrive.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Within the industry, some of the challenges that these women face are finding the right people, a challenge common to almost every sector. Suhasini says, “It’s difficult to find the right people in PR. Since it’s a service industry largely dependent on skill and art, it is people-centric.” Tejasvi and Purvi add, finding people with the ability to take initiative and be accountable, and when you are not sure about something, to have the ability to figure it out is tough. We can train and teach many things but we can’t instill this in people. In our field, everything moves super fast; we need to find the right kind of people who share the same kind of passion as you.</p>
<h2><strong>The startup boom and it’s impact on the PR industry</strong></h2>
<p>With so many startups mushrooming across India, PR is in demand. However, Nandita is quick to point out that this isn’t the first boom the PR industry has witnessed.</p>
<p>She says, “My company has been the beneficiary of the startup boom in the year 2000. The startup environment, though, is different from what it was then. Scale is the operative word; founders have work experience and are quitting lucrative jobs to get a taste of entrepreneurship, investors are demanding, even though there is no dearth of capital &#8211; the operating environment is tougher and more competitive. So, these are exciting and challenging times. It offers PR firms like ours an opportunity to go beyond media relations, to being trusted advisors for new entrepreneurs by helping them with strategic solutions and programs.”</p>
<p>Suhasini too has seen several cycles over the last few years. She says, “Working in the VC and startup space for a while has given a deeper understanding of the ecosystem. We’ve closely seen the challenges that an entrepreneur goes through — the highs and lows and how communication is at the crux of it all.”</p>
<h2><strong>Technology and digital media</strong></h2>
<p>Technology has caused disruptions in many fields; the rise of digital media and the multiple social media channels have also impacted the PR industry. Nandita says, “The advent of digital has ensured there is a level playing field for what was once distinctly compartmentalised into advertising, direct marketing, public relations etc. It has provided a platform for stakeholder voices and clearly made the click mightier than the pen. In many ways, it has shifted the power quotient from those who held it. And when stakeholders gain strength, public relations will thrive because this is one discipline that focuses on listening, building and sustaining relationships with the public.”</p>
<p>Suhasini points out how technology has changed the way content is delivered and therefore packaged for different mediums and audiences. We’ve all become more connected, accessible, faster. Now, the news is delivered faster on Twitter and WhatsApp, and so is the case with ‘thoughts’ on Medium and ‘client communication’ on Slack. The way organisations work has changed and so has PR – whether it is external communication or internal. PR experts offer specialised and strategic advice to their clientele on how to manage their digital image, inter alia, to deepen engagement with target audiences.</p>
<h2><strong>Adaptability and agility is the name of the game</strong></h2>
<p>Given the growth this industry is going to achieve by 2020 the primary skillset for those in the industry to survive will be adaptability and agility. Technological disruptions and growth of digital media has already prepared the PR industry to adapt. Suhasini, Nandita, Tejasvi and Purvi all believe that those who have agility, and don’t fear hard work will go a long way in this industry.</p>
