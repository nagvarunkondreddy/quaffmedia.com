				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT professional Ashish Raveendran postponed buying the latest iPhone for six months. He used that time to pore through consumer reviews, do product research and closely follow reviews of tech gurus and friends. “I had to be sure it would be long-lasting and had all the latest upgrades,” says the Bangalore techie, who had saved for two years for the iPhone. Value for money is what millennials like Raveendran (27 years) look for while buying a device. And, like most millennials, he’s heavily “dependent” on his gizmos– his iPad and an Apple watch included to keep him plugged on to his phone 24X7 and to monitor his fitness levels.</p>
<p>Take the case of media professional Suvarna K (26) too. Her need to “stay connected to the world” makes her shop for at least three consumer tech products in a year. More recently, her shopping wish list has expanded to include a smartwatch and a voice assistant. Spending about Rs 45,000 a year on tech, she tucks away a small part of her salary each month for her big ticket purchases.</p>
<p>“After interacting with Alexa at a friend’s place, I am really excited about voice assistants now,” says this millennial, who admits wryly that she spends a significant part of her day on her gadgets, catching up on new music videos and OTT shows on her mobile or swiping through her Instagram feeds a zillion times.</p>
<p><strong>The Digital Native Millennials</strong></p>
<p>The Millennial, who is anyone born after 1982, is a big consumer of tech products at present. It is this group that tech brands are pursuing now it seems. Difficult to ignore, millennials constitute nearly 46 per cent of country’s total population ( a Morgan Stanley report) and are the ones, with “high disposable incomes” and spending power. Studies reveal that they are mostly chief wage earners in a household and tend to spend rather than save. So, brands are tweaking products and marketing strategies to appeal to this digital native bunch.</p>
<p>For example, PC brands have moved away from making generic computers. To cater to the varying needs and evolving tastes of millennials, there are PCs for doctors or video editors, PCs for students, one for entertainment or for gaming. Or, a Thinkpad for the uber professional etc. Also brands find it challenging to pin down a millennial’s persona since they like to keep their identities fluid. Millennials are entirely different from their previous generation by their lifestyle choices and consumption patterns but few common threads have emerged in the past few years.</p>
<p><strong>The Influential Millennials</strong></p>
<p>To begin with, social media obviously plays a big role in choices “connected” millennials make. According to Raveendran, millennials are continuously connected to social media and this helps to make choices faster. “The discovery phase of shopping is happening online”, confirms Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI). “In one of our surveys, 85 per cent of 50,000 customers discovered products online. They pore through reviews, hunt for comparisons, analysis and then buy a product,” he says. Social media is teeming with user experiences and stories shared on the web, ratings, recommendations and they act as user generated advertorial content.</p>
<p>Therefore, brands need to look at millennials as “prime influencers” and not just prime consumers, suggests Kumar Rajagopalan. For millennial user reviews are read by older consumers too and of late, millennials seem to be advising and influencing their grandparents to use new gadgets to manage their lives better, he says.</p>
<p><strong>The Fitness Drive</strong></p>
<p>Millennials dislike being “boxed” in a group but a factor that commonly drives millennials is product value. A fact also echoed by Jayalakshmi R (24 years), a tech geek. “I look for durability, hard-core value and features like VR or AR enabled rather than look for an expensive brand,” says this PR professional, who finds plenty of value in her fitness band, which warns her if her lifestyle is turning sedentary. Here’s one more millennial trait – they are increasingly health conscious and lay a lot of emphasis on their physical and emotional well-being. Studies seem to substantiate this theory: 36 per cent of Indian millennials have a fitness app installed on their phones and about 45 per cent believe a healthy life is essential.</p>
<p>Besides, millennials need nudging, says Jayalakshmi. “We are a distracted lot with so much happening around us, we need to be reminded of our daily chores,” she adds with a grin.</p>
<p><strong>Authentic Conversations</strong></p>
<p>Millennials are also driven by “authentic conversations” online to buy tech. There’s less attention given to staged and paid reviews. “No longer do millennials aspire for what others project on social media, which may often be fake,” suggests Jayalakshmi. So, they scour the Net to get to influencers with honest reviews.<br />
Some head to Instagram pages of the product directly to source real reviews. In this situation, it is key for brands to resonate with what millennials care about. Social causes are very much the vogue, and experts say millennials prefer a brand that does not sit on the fence and goes all out to voice its opinions. But, brands needs to keep communication subtle and intelligent and not go for the overkill.</p>
<p><strong>Constant Innovation</strong></p>
<p>The limitless access to information, communication and entertainment are however rewiring their brains and changing their responses to marketing stimuli. So, marketing gurus believe that brands have to continuously innovate to keep up with a Nielsen study description of them–“Millennials may be many things, but they may not be what you expect.” So, very often, experts advise brands to blend in with social circles of millennials, which are mostly online and mobile, and stress on creativity and authenticity to keep them hooked.</p>
<p>In the end, Kumar Rajagopalan’s advice might be worth mulling over: “Brands need to think like a 20/20 player – their messages have to be short, effective and thrilling. Secondly, more importantly, brands need to be in sync with how millennials use social media. A platform that is relevant now might not be tomorrow and so brands have to monitor the kind of social media millennials inhabit. Take the case of how popular OTT platforms are with them now as an example. Brands need to be where they are to catch their attention.” Move in their world to know them seems to be a useful mantra then to stay with for now!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India’s diversity is perhaps best represented by the sheer variety of languages that are spoken across the nation. Currently, there are more than 120 languages with at least 10,000 speakers each. For decades this has offered lucrative opportunities in the form of targeted content that helped to not just tap into new markets, but also expand in exhausted spaces. Until the early 2000s, this happened mainly through the print medium, along with audio and video streams. Now digital has come up as the latest platform to employ India’s indigenous languages to drive improved outreach to people across the world.</p>
<p>Digital opportunities in Indic languages can be assessed by the fact that by 2021, non-English internet users will account for nearly 75 percent of the nation’s total internet user base. India’s internet market had around 570 million users as of end-2018, and this is expected to grow to 630 million by end-2019. India has come up as one of the fastest-growing internet markets globally, owing to a rapid rise in smartphone usage as well as the availability of the cheapest mobile data prices in the world. The promises this has offered have led to Indian and foreign firms racing to best access the business scope in Indic languages.</p>
<p><strong>Scale of opportunity</strong></p>
<p>The scale of opportunities has been vast &#8211; from content for a variety of online platforms such as social media outlets, news and entertainment portals as well as government and consumer services, to content for devices and services powered by new-gen technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML). Strategic digital communications in Indic languages have also recorded strong success. To further this, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), along with leading technology developers, has set up the FICCI-Indian Language Internet Alliance (FICCI-ILIA).</p>
<p>Apart from supporting business opportunities in the digitisation of Indic languages, FICCI-ILIA has united the stakeholders who have been operating in the Indic language space for nearly two decades. The ecosystem has allowed proactive exchanges of ideas and objectives, as well as knowledge and best practices.</p>
<p>Internet giants such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon have already taken up Indic languages to empower their outreach. This has led to a proliferation of Indic language applications and websites with a mobile-first focus that are targeting first-time smartphone users as well as users in India’s tier-2 and 3 markets. Therefore, the development of technologies to support digital content in Indic languages is seeing intense activity. Investments in the space, which cover both hardware and software, have provided fast inroads into India’s untapped semi-urban and rural markets that promise strong income growth.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges on the way</strong></p>
<p>Inadequate hardware and software support for Indic languages online have restricted the growth of the sector. There are also difficulties with monetisation of content, lack of ample Indic language text corpus, innovation related to services such as accurate language translation, availability of funding and skill sets, apart from the challenges with technology standardisation. While content creation in Indic languages has been held back owing to the lack of technological support, challenges around integrating Indic languages into payment gateways have limited online commerce. Weak digital awareness has also restricted growth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, concerns around data security and privacy have become more complicated in non-English internet. Additionally, correcting fake online information in Indic languages has gotten especially difficult. In the recent past, fake news in Indic languages has led to online harassment, even fatal mob attacks.</p>
<p>However, these challenges have encouraged R&amp;D of remedial measures. Be it through technology innovation, improved content marketing, skill development, or technologies to guide mass dissemination of information, the challenges in the Indian internet space are being increasingly dealt with. This will drive technological empowerment of India’s youth-heavy 1.3 billion population &#8211; a vital aspect of the nation&#8217;s economic development. Going ahead, Indic language internet, a key enabler in bridging India’s digital divide, will offer increased opportunities to investors and innovators alike. This will be critical in cementing India’s global leadership.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before the US elections of 2016, I spent a month travelling to meet people in various parts of that country. As an outsider, my reading of the Trump phenomenon was very different from what I was hearing from those around me. I had a strong gut feeling that he was becoming a mouthpiece for sentiments that many Americans related to but never expressed openly. Until now, political correctness along with all the other constraints of a society that wants to be viewed as progressive and democratic had kept many of these sentiments at bay. But Trump was tapping into something very fundamental – a deep-seated sense of fear and anxiety among people. It was a palpable phenomenon. One could feel its currents in the air. But everyone I spoke to denied that it was a real one. They felt it was impossible that somebody with his temperament could become the leader of the ‘free world’.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we feel about the outcome of that election, it does reaffirm the value of gut instincts. This is neither a new nor a revolutionary concept. History is littered with examples of effective leaders who were adept at reading the pulse of their audiences. Clearly, technology is not the most critical factor in this exercise. That is not to suggest that the miraculous digital tools at our disposal are not really helping. But we cannot dismiss the value of personal relationships and human contact in the midst of all this. Now more than ever, there is a need to understand and acknowledge behaviors and motivations – in situations that are not entirely familiar to us. We have to accept that our reality may be very different from someone else’s.</p>
<p>Leaders who fail to recognize that fact may find themselves on a slippery slope. Take the general restrained reaction to the challenges of demonetization in the country. Those who do not feel its pain on a daily basis are presuming that everybody across the country feels the same way. But maybe the reaction from rural India is muted because its residents lack platforms to express their fears and concerns. What happens when and if those floodgates open?</p>
<p>Similarly, businesses that build their products and services based on a limited worldview will see this strategy backfiring on them sooner or later. We cannot develop a cohesive strategy around the behavior of a small segment of the population that thinks and acts as we do. It is important to examine various strata and sub-groups within the target market in order to uncover their pain points, motivations, habits and more. This exercise will open our minds to a reality that is different from what we experience and live on a daily basis. If the events of 2016 have taught us anything, it is the importance of listening for more than just the reinforcing signals of our private bubbles.</p>
<p>Listening – truly listening – to your customer requires time, effort and money. But there is no substitute for it in today’s reality. Yet, many companies keep forging ahead – with blinders on – and are then surprised to find the ground shifting from underneath them.</p>
<p>The other key challenge for leaders and businesses lies in building authentic narratives in the midst of so much noise. We are surrounded by un-validated views and news that are being amplified – through various echo chambers – to an audience that is not really thinking for itself. In an age of increasing cynicism, the very platforms designed for authentic communication have lost their sheen and credibility. The word ‘authentic’ itself has become loaded to the extent where it is hard to know what it means any more.</p>
<p>A leader who chooses to be a loose cannon on twitter, for example, may be viewed as authentic by some and rashly impulsive by others. It is possible that such public airing of opinion – without active control and curation – is the new normal in the world today. There is a lot more pressure for leaders to navigate and figure out where the boundaries lie in all of this. What is clear is that there is very low tolerance now for communication that is superficial or sanitized. We need to find ways to bring the heart into it. If it strikes an emotional chord in people, then it is more likely to be viewed as both authentic and effective. I found a good example of this recently in a heartfelt letter by the CEO of a multinational pharma company in which he expressed his anguish with predatory pricing and other questionable practices in the industry and described how his organization aimed to counter these.</p>
<p>We live in times when a single event can disrupt the status quo in an instant. A recent example of this can be found in the way the fortunes of one mainstream newspaper – the Hindustan Times – nosedived overnight. Its business model, already weakened by the digital revolution, crumbled under the weight of demonetization. Being alert to such threats is increasingly important for an organization.</p>
<p>There are also some fundamental aspects of our lives that appear to be under siege. One involves freedom of the press and, at a broader level, freedom of speech. Safeguarding these freedoms was always critical and is even more so now. The second aspect – the right to privacy – is something we have to debate in a clear-eyed manner. While Facebook and Google are among the biggest purveyors of data, government mandates to get broad access to it can change the landscape dramatically. Should we surrender all data to the government of the day who is neither building nor intending to build checks and balances to protect it? It is important to be conscious of these developments in our environment and to scrutinize them for both intent and impact.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, reputation management in today’s reality involves getting back to basics. We also have to realize that we cannot base all our decisions on pure data. Human connections are as important today as they were before the digital revolution. Forging and cultivating these will still be key in an era of technological and business disruption.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="news-author">Arijit Sengupta, Vice President &#8211; Public Advocacy, The PRactice</p>
<h3><em><strong>The biggest gainer of an EV only drive will be the power sector. However, this is not an open and shut case. There are significant assumptions being made that might prove to be its undoing.</strong></em></h3>
<div class="article_text_desc">
<p>As an important element of the formulation of a larger policy initiative by the government to migrate from a fossil fuel based economy to one that of an eco-friendly one, this article considers the inherent challenges that the country faces during this transition with particular emphasis on the auto sector and how it impacts the eco-system, and what can be the likely and desired outcomes that would benefit the country.</p>
<p>The Core objectives are the outcomes of the various meetings and plenary sessions attended by governments across the world during the COP 21 (Paris Climate Accord) and with the stated aim of reducing the carbon emissions by 80% from the 1990 levels and to limit global temperature rise to little over 2⁰ Celsius by 2050. As part of the broader desire by governments and people around the world to reduce carbon based emissions, three sectors will see a paradigm shift in the way they function and by extension will also impact other sectors that are in some way correlated or have dependencies inherent with them. The three principal sectors are primarily Oil and Gas, Automotive and Power generation.</p>
<p>The automotive sector is a significant one in the case of India. Any disruption or large-scale shift will be more likely prove to be disastrous and cost inefficient if enforced ad hoc and without supporting elements to stabilize it during this transitive phase. The sector contributes to a significant part of India’s GDP and employs millions in both upstream and downstream processes. As of 2017, the sector is around 8+ percent of India’s GDP and estimated to be around USD 100 Billion dollars. The sector also attracted significant FDI on a YoY basis and is one of the few shining examples of the “make in India” initiative.</p>
<p>Given this background, any policy that advocates a rapid and complete makeover needs to be debated prior to actual enforcement and adoption. This is fundamental and should not be ignored if we are to maximise on the gains of the last 30 years. Part of the problem statement here revolves around the nature of disruption. Disruption can be iterative or fundamental. The automotive sector has had a long history of disruption of both technology and ideas. These were organic/iterative in nature (post initial inventions of combustion engine, gears etc). Meaning that technology and engineering were called upon to resolve issues of efficiencies and processes. The basic premise of automobiles and the fundamental way they work have remained unchanged for around the last 100 years or so. An electric vehicle only focus will be a disruption of another dimension altogether. This shift will call into question the accepted way automobiles are designed, manufactured, powered and operated and will bear no resemblance to the automobiles of the last century or so. And we need to keep in mind that the technology that we want to adopt is still in a developmental stage with no clear global standards emerging. This makes adoption a double-edged sword. There have been multiple approaches made and the focus has entirely been to benchmark them against gasoline powered vehicles to demonstrate their efficiencies and competitiveness. This is a strange conundrum and points towards a larger issue.</p>
<p>While writing this, one cannot but think of another great idea that came about post 1945. Nuclear power! The late fifties saw this magic isotope that was the next big idea for global change and a source of unending power for people. 70 years hence, we have trepidations when nuclear power is discussed. The problem was not the nuclear fuel as a power source, but how to operate (safely) process, store and dispose of nuclear waste that became the millstone around its neck. And what&#8217;s the relation between electric vehicles and nuclear power? Nothing at first glance, but if we look deeper, the ramifications start to become apparent.</p>
<p>Electric vehicles (as of now) depend on stored electricity or capacitor driven charge for locomotion. The batteries are comprised of harmful chemicals that require safe disposal and waste management. Failure to do so would lead to catastrophic harm to both the environment and humans in general. A rise in the number of vehicles will see an even greater rise in the mining of harmful rare elements and manufacturing of such batteries. And given the lack of enforcement and generally lax safety standards in a country like India &#8211; this is just the tip of the iceberg. Another factor is that India depends on polluting power feed stock such as coal and gas to generate electricity. A rise in EV would see a corresponding rise in power requirements and thereby adding to the emissions generated and negating the very reason for the switch to electric locomotion.</p>
<p>What then is the way forward one might ask? The principal task of Policy is to provide a direction and guidance for selecting the Technology path and consequently fix and govern the rules of operation and engagement. Ideally policy needs to be the right mix of serving as a vision document for the foreseeable future as well as detail the laws under which all players must operate. Policy makers are often guilty of emphasising the vision document while leaving the actual operational detailing to concerned government departments to interpret and enumerate. This creates a discordant note between the lofty ideals of what the policy aims to achieve with what it achieves. The EV policy must be comprehensive and aim to fix issues before they become apparent.</p>
<p>Given the nature of dependencies of each ministry and industry groups, there will be a significant element of disruption leading to revenue loss and rebalancing that needs to be undertaken by each player. In terms of extreme revenue loss, the Finance ministry, Petroleum ministry and Fuel distributors will be the hardest hit &#8211; in the realms of epochal levels at best. The Finance ministry will lose tax revenues collected from the sale of gasoline and diesel. The hardest hit in terms of revenues will the petroleum downstream chain. As of 2014, 34% of downstream revenues and taxes were generated by the sale of gasoline and diesel which also paid for the subsidies in LPG. This is a double whammy for the Government. They will not only lose revenues from sale of gasoline but also lose if they continue to dole out subsidised LPG. The impact on downstream oil majors like IOCL, Reliance, BPCL and HPCL will need to be analysed. They stand to lose around 35% of their captive market by 2030. And recent media reports of trebling oil refining business, when the largest component of consumption is looking to replace oil altogether calls into question the reasoning and planning that is taking place, or not in reality.</p>
<p>The automotive industry (manufacturers as well as ancillaries and suppliers) will have a mixed level of disruption. The big manufacturers will have a short to medium term period where they have to invest in re-aligning their manufacturing, R&amp;D and business plans. This will call for extreme re-alignment as they might to have to relook existing manufacturing facilities and consider greenfield options. It might also entail joining hands with traditional rivals to overcome lack of research and R&amp;D in EV options. But their chances of being able to make the transition is brighter than ancillary or support units. These are the units that are most likely to be the hardest hit in terms of business going forward. For a start, they are labour intensive and lack the technological backing to have independent R&amp;D to help them in the transition. In most cases, given the fundamental requirements of EV technology, most mechanical auto parts will become largely irrelevant. Units dealing with gearing equipment, transmission, engine and engine parts will have to either shut down or switch to serving other industries.</p>
<p>The biggest gainer of an EV only drive will be the power sector. However, this is not an open and shut case. There are significant assumptions being made that might prove to be its undoing. At present there is a gross mismatch between the installed total power capacity in India and consumption. While there is slight surplus in terms of gross power capacity, the reality is that power is not stable and losses from transmission and theft are significantly higher than global averages. Power is also subject to political compulsions. SEB’s are heavily leveraged and loss making as a rule. The sector has seen significant write offs due to political interferences especially aimed at the farming and rural segments to garner political influence. This in turn raises prices for urban consumers.</p>
<p>Thermal power (which is the dirtiest) is the largest contributor to the grid. And this is not going to change by 2030. While India has made significant advances in Renewable power generation, opaque laws and disregard for existing PPA’s by SEB’s have seen a downward spiral in tariffs for renewables. This has effectively stymied investment in this sector. Another important factor is that the established national grid infrastructure has not been able to stabilize renewable power. In light of this, a correct approach that is ring fenced from political interferences is the need of the hour. And estimated new/replacement 100 million vehicles on Indian roads will increase the requirements for power significantly. This in turn has the propensity to increase our dependence on coal fired generating plants unless the government firmly establishes the need to use renewable power as the principal source for this purpose.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the EV push &#8211; Electricity will be the de facto new fuel for vehicular locomotion. Under this new approach it would be interesting to study the possible framework that the government adopts when devising a pricing matrix. The 4 fundamental aspects to Power will be Generation, Distribution, Storage and Usage. As of now quite strangely, we do not hear much about what the government is thinking in terms of “this” power. There is no clarity of how India will proceed and therein lies the conundrum. There should be clarity in terms of how India is planning on generating additional power to cater to the needs of electric only vehicles by 2030. The rider is that generating more power from Coal, Gas or Oil will only increase emissions and pollution and be counterproductive. Clearly the answer is that India has to invest in Renewables and more specifically on Solar and Wind power for generation.</p>
<p>The problem here is that the existing network/grid has to find viable means of storing and distributing this renewable power and the state electricity discoms which are largely government run enterprises have to purchase this additional power at rational costs. Strangely governments around the country have reneged on existing PPA’s and bidding wars between Power generating companies have resulted in Solar power achieving a sale price of INR 2.44/kWh. This when the minimum sale price should be in the region of INR 5/kWh. This means that it’s not a viable option to keep producing or expanding Renewables. Another issue with Renewables have been that while some areas of the country are more conducive to generating renewable power while the rest are not. And because the grid has not been open to fundamental and large-scale changes to accommodate non-traditional power for distribution, more often than not, Renewable power generators have not been able to push through sales even with lower tariffs due to cost of distribution and perceived transmission losses across longer distances.</p>
<p><strong>The Utility versus Commodity Conundrum. </strong>The dichotomy in generation costs brings us to another observation &#8211; what happens to power that is generated by differing sources? Will they be priced uniformly? Will Renewable power be priced (for consumers) at a discount as compared to Thermal? If so &#8211; then the differential loss in earnings for the distribution companies will be an issue. And if Renewable power will not be retailed at discounts &#8211; will the consumer be allowed to choose what type of power they would like to purchase? In a free market economy &#8211; this is a distinct possibility, but in a government controlled economy like India &#8211; this point might be moot. Globally, state controlled discoms have not been part of the distribution/retail of power for vehicles. And there is a very good reason for this &#8211; electricity has been commoditized as a retail product for vehicles &#8211; this as a concept is not in the DNA of the state discoms who still treat Power as an utility. However in India with notions of state control for greater good &#8211; the push back against private distribution and retail of power has been a potential deal breaker from a social/political perspective. This needs to be addressed and incremental policy changes might not work.</p>

<div></div>
<div>
<p>In the first piece of this three-part series, I introduced the relevance of systems thinking for development and CSR. The second piece talked about how systems thinking can be applied in practice with a range of approaches and methodologies. In this concluding piece, I will reflect on some of the skills-sets desired in a systems thinker and the challenges they may face in putting systems thinking to work.</p>
<p>The first challenge for a systems thinker to overcome is that of siloed thinking. Beginning from the time of Taylor, one of the founding fathers of modern management, we are trained in reductionist principles to approach work by dividing projects into individual parts as much as possible and applying a rule book for every part, in the name of efficiency. Time and again, we are told that once an objective is decided, we need to break it down in manageable chunks and conquer the goal step-by-step. This often makes us lose sight of the woods for the trees.</p>
<p>But the problem is more deep-rooted. Look at how Universities are structured by Departments under the overall segments of Arts, Sciences and Commerce/Management, disallowing the power of inter- and trans-disciplinary knowledge pollination. This pedagogy creates siloed thinking in a practitioner’s mind and restricts them from approaching situations as a ‘whole.’</p>
<p>The way out of this quagmire is to first overhaul the way we are trained to think. Education bodies need to encourage integrated thinking. This is to be facilitated not only in a way in which students have the flexibility to chose subjects from different disciplines but also at a higher level where the essence of design thinking, problem-solving and critical ontology are introduced in curriculum from an early age. We do see a welcome change with many of the new Universities in India introducing degrees that cut across disciplines and encourage students to work on real-life problem solving with an open mind, rather than sticking to the traditional approaches of textbook learning bound within Departments.</p>
<p>The second challenge is inherent in how we think and the expectations that govern us in designing development or CSR interventions. Although today we see an upsurge in giving, facilitated by individual philanthropy, CSR regulation and impact investments, there is also increasing pressure in measurement with the focus on quantitative indices to measure successes under time-bound metrics. Different corporations and foundations increasingly subject “beneficiaries” to report impact (normally understood in terms output and outcomes) under a regime of inflexible success measures.</p>
<p>However, a systems intervention often needs flexibility and agility. Often the systems need to be allowed to learn through the course of an intervention and course-correct or course-align as it proceeds. The feedback loop needs to be continual for constant adaptation and be able to “change the wheels of the car when it is still being driven”. The need for the funder and the interventionist is to ensure open-ended processes and be able to approach both measurement and impact with flexibility. CSR projects here will need to look at a problem-solving approach, rather than a mere compliance-seeking approach. This means that results can take longer than what we are used to, but they are more meaningful and more sustainable.</p>
<p>The third challenge is more implementation-related. Systems thinking calls for the practitioner to be well versed with a range of approaches and methodologies to fully leverage the power of the discipline. In my last piece itself, I talked about eleven popular methodologies under three paradigms, and this was just touching the surface. In addition of these, there are a large number of tools and techniques that the systems world has to offer. This can sometimes lead to confusion and be intimidating to someone new who may want to start working in this discipline.</p>
<p>However, it is to be noted that a systems practitioner does not need to be an expert in every approach or methodology. But it is important to be having an overall understanding of what exists so that they can bring in the right kind of expertise for specific situations at hand. There are also frameworks in systems thinking that help in organising different approaches in specific categories corresponding to the complexity of the situation and nature of participation. This supports the interventionist select the right methodology in combination for respective issues they are trying to resolve by taking a step-by-step approach. Total System Intervention (TSI) is one such framework. Developed by Flood and Jackson, TSI presents a framework that helps a practitioner to apply creative thinking to understand the situation, leading to the selection of methodologies in isolation or in combination, and finally in implementation with the model of continual learning inbuilt into the framework.</p>
<p>In light of this discussion, a systems practitioner needs the following skills to be able to optimally deliver on an intervention:</p>
<p>Openness in thinking<br />
Critical thinking to look beyond the obvious and question the institution<br />
Flexibility to move seamlessly between disciplines<br />
Humility to call for support wherever required and accept that no intervention can be the best intervention in a human activity system<br />
Patience; this helps in chasing impact and not immediate results</p>
<p>I conclude this series with the thought that development interventions, including CSR, do not merit a cookie-cutter-approach. As I discussed in my first piece, every situation is unique and calls for a unique resolution. Openness, learning and adaptiveness remain unquestionably the most important traits of a systems thinker. As the development sector becomes more sophisticated and organisations move forward adopting CSR at the strategic level, systems thinking will be more and more relevant in the increasingly complex world that we live in. Organisations need to endeavour to approach both business and CSR processes as integrated if the latter needs to be aligned to strategic objectives.</p>

<div></div>
<div>
<p>In my first <a href="http://thecsrjournal.in/systems-thinking-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piece</a> in this three-part series, I introduced systems thinking and discussed why it is so relevant for the development sector and CSR. In this second piece, I will talk about some prominent approaches, methodologies and tools for the on-ground application of systems thinking.</p>
<p>Systems thinking has inspired several approaches and methodologies over time. These can be categorised under three main waves.</p>
<p>The first wave looked at situations from a “hard” standpoint and relied on prediction and control. The second wave took a “soft” approach and proposed that situations can only be understood when one immerses themselves into the condition of the target group and looks inside-out. The third wave lends a critical lens into systemic interventions. It approaches every situation as a “human activity system” and seeks to identify the inherent purpose behind the existence of individuals and emergent systems.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a development project through the stages of design, implementation and measurement.</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>The design phase involves a wide range of stakeholder appreciation and consultations, given the nature of development projects. This will take into consideration a varied range of interest groups including organisation management, employees, beneficiaries, the wider community, rights groups, service providers, funders, civil society, local administration and legislation, amongst others. It is important to account for perspectives and requirements of as many interest groups as possible.</p>
<p>Stakeholder Mapping is an often used systems tool to exhaustively lists out your stakeholder universe, and understand them in the context of their power in the ecosystem and their interest in your organisation/project.</p>
<p>Appreciative Inquiry is another approach that focuses on what works right in a human activity system by exploring strengths, successes, values and aspirations.</p>
<p>Soft System Methodology (SSM) is a classic systems methodology that helps converge a wide range of stakeholders through a creative seven-step process. The process attempts to embrace complexity by not shying away from eliciting differences, by digging into root causes and by tapping into creative energies of participants through a well-structured process.</p>
<p>FSG talks about another useful tool called Ecocycle Mapping that draws its understanding from biological research to categorise situations into the four quadrants of development, conservation, destruction and renewal that is seen in natural (ecological) systems. Aided by a well-structured appreciation, a situation can be plotted in one of the four quadrants mentioned above and appropriate interventions can be directed to it. The tool is inspired by the understanding that adaptiveness and sustainability of organisations are impingement on those organisations undergoing periodic natural processes of destruction and renewal.</p>
<p>For highly complex projects where there are various sub-systems interacting with numerous variables, System Dynamics (SD) comes in handy to understand nonlinear behaviour and emergent patterns. There is various simulation-based software in the market that can help in an SD analysis for scientific prediction and forecasting.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>Effective implementation of projects requires both structure and flexibility. The structure provides focus and channelises energies and resources in the right direction. Flexibility enables a system to be adaptive and agile.</p>
<p>Viable System Model (VSM) is one approach that helps in organising a system in a way that they will be capable to meet the demands of a changing environment within controlled conditions. VSM helps in implementation by putting in place a well-oiled machinery of five sub-systems – implementation, coordination, control, development, and strategy – with each having its own distinct role and interactions between one another.</p>
<p>Often, during implementation, there can be major differences between teams or groups, which come as roadblocks to development projects. When there are two dominant opposing sides, Strategic Assumption Surfacing and Testing (SAST) can come handy for an interventionist to help teams work towards “synthesis”. SAST follows a four-step process where tools like stakeholder mapping, group formation, risk analyses, assumption ratings and dialectic debate come into play to facilitate convergence towards a common agreement, which helps the program to move forward overcoming hindrances.</p>
<p>As implementation proceeds, it is important to document the experiences in line with internal and external factors. This helps to understand of how your initiative is progressing in relation to the overall plan laid out in the design stage. FSG talks about an interesting tool called Timeline Mapping, which can help in maintaining a chronological map of events, activities, grants, actions, achievements, and other milestone markers in a defined format. This establishes interrelationships between the events and also with the external context – social, economic and political. Timeline Mapping helps project managers have a real-time project assessment as we go along and undertake any realignment if required.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement</strong></p>
<p>Measurement needs to be built into all the stages of an intervention, and not something that is considered as an after-thought. The intervention always needs to start with defining the parameters that will ascertain its success metrics. Relevant benchmarks and relative reality can be used to articulate timelines and targets.</p>
<p>A systems interventionist will approach measurement holistically with an assessment framework that takes into account aspects around community outcomes, stakeholders influenced, process efficiencies &amp; effectiveness, and summative impact.</p>
<p>The Theory of Change is a globally well-accepted program management and measurement methodology for the development sector, but it has also attracted its fair share of critics due to its inability to take into consideration the more qualitative and critical elements of change of a human activity system. This can be complemented with Critical System Heuristics (CSH), a systems approach that can come as a good assessment technique that looks at interventions from two perspectives – what is happening in an intervention and what out to have happened. This technique is well structured with a set of a twelve-question framework that explores several aspects of an intervention in the “is” and the “ought” modes, pinned on the systems concept of “boundaries”.</p>
<p>Rethinking strategy and planning is an important outcome, once measurement and assessment is completed. Interactive Planning (IP) is a well-documented methodology that can help in the retrospection progress made and how an organization could be more optimal in leveraging its own resources and capabilities. IP brings in a structured approach that helps in envisioning the desired ideal state in the current scenario in an attempt to change the mindset of planners to think in terms of an ideal-seeking achievable within the current circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong></p>
<p>Systems thinking brings in a wide array of tools and methodologies for an interventionist. Above are some of the most commonly used that can come handy for a development interventionist.</p>
<p>These tools and methodologies are influenced by the different waves in systems thinking that I introduced right at the beginning of this article. The most optimum leverage is achieved when they are used complementary to one another. Similarly in the development sector, design, implementation and measurement may not be treated as water-tight stages. Systems approaches introduced above can be used through the different stages depending on which aspect of the tool is emphasised more at the what stage.</p>
<p>In the next and concluding piece, I will reflect upon some of the skill sets required for a systems interventionist.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While contributing a piece to talk about effective management of CSR projects, I thought that we need to take a step back. It is heartening to see that governments and civil society across the world have taken up the responsibility to proactively work towards the development of the underprivileged. Billions have been allocated, spent (or even misspent) in development projects across the world.</p>
<p>India became the first country in the world to make a corporate commitment for CSR mandatory for companies beyond a certain threshold.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4971 size-full" src="http://staging.the-practice.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0003_System-thinking-for-development.png" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://the-practice.net/wpr2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0003_System-thinking-for-development.png 750w, https://the-practice.net/wpr2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0003_System-thinking-for-development-300x200.png 300w, https://the-practice.net/wpr2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0003_System-thinking-for-development-350x234.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />We are certainly in the right direction in terms of attitude, legislation and participation. However, to make interventions in the development sector work, we need more than that. We need effective strategies, efficient execution and robust measurements. This is not easy.</p>
<p>Hence, I am sharing my own take on effective management of CSR projects, or more generally, development projects. Given the nuances and intricacies, the development sector presents, I am sharing my thoughts in a three-part series to present why systems thinking is essential in this sector. This first piece will focus on introducing the concept of systems thinking and its relevance, the second one will talk about how it can be applied for design, execution and measurement of development sector work, and the final piece will highlight some of the skill sets required for a systems interventionist and its related challenges.</p>
<p>When we speak of working in the development sector, what typically comes to our mind is poverty, education, backward classes/casts, health, sanitation, water, so on and so forth. It is common to see funds being allocated to specific areas such as these, but what is more important is to understand how many (or all) of these areas interact with one another and how an individual is impacted in the ecosystem he/she is in.</p>
<p>Let’s consider Baahubali (I picked up a trending name), who lives in a village near a chemical company and works for the same company. He is poor and the company has allocated CSR funds for the education of the village, for which Baahubali’s son is a beneficiary. But the child (Baahubali’s son) drinks untreated water from the river nearby as he does not have a water purifier at home. The water is severely contaminated because of the chemical company, where Baahubali is employed, flushes its industrial waste into the river. Baahubali’s wife is a small-time fisherwoman and is now out of business as the contaminated water of the river has over the years killed most of the fish in the river. Baahubali’s son constantly falls ill due to drinking contaminated water and all the family earnings go in his treatments, and eventually, he has to drop out of school. Similar was the case with other families. The company eventually stopped its funds for education in the village as their measurement metrics showed a drop of student enrolment in schools over time. Several families in the village had similar experience leading to increasing deprivation, and antisocial behaviour. A village that has lived in poverty for generations is now being pushed into a bleak future of more abject poverty and dissonance.</p>
<p>So what did you notice? The CSR funds of the company that was going for education is a complete waste. Not only could the company do anything to educate the children in the village, but also made the situation worse for them by contaminating the river.</p>
<p>Let’s get more local for India – consider families in abject poverty taking small loans from moneylenders, indebted for life and constantly being harassed for payments. Add caste. Add no toilets. Add violence against women and children. The list never ends.</p>
<p>This is a complex problem. Complex problems cannot be solved by allocating money for CSR. This needs a very different mindset.</p>
<p>Systems thinking is a discipline that lends a holistic lens whilst approaching a situation. A “system” is constituted of various elements or sub-systems, which are in perennial interaction with one another leading to both intended and unintended consequences, as a result of which the system itself has emergent behaviors. We read the story of Baahubali and his village above, and we can already see some of these. Every system has a boundary, outside of which there is the environment. Hence boundaries themselves can be dynamic. What is important is not the elements per se, but the interrelationships between them, because it is the nature of the interrelationships that give character to the system. Inputs to the system are transformed within it and go out as output, which in turn informs further input with feedback.</p>
<p>A systems mindset helps us to appreciate complexity with a critical mindset considering a variety of impinging factors.</p>
<p>The development sector is faced with huge challenges and complexities. Lack of funds is just one of them, and it’s not the top one. Significant funds mobilization has been enabled through philanthropy, CSR and impact investments. But other challenges include the lack of strategic planning, efficiency in execution, poor governance, social and political interference, and the lack of integration between various initiatives operating and yet not connecting with one another. Don’t be surprised at all if there were another large company near the same village where Baahubali lives that manufactures cement and is pushing in CSR funds for better health care in the village, and yet both companies are not talking to each other!</p>
<p>Complex situations have their own characteristics. At the outset, they are difficult to pen-down, or sometimes even difficult to imagine. They start evolving as we get into them. We need to look beyond the surface and dig below what is evident to unearth what is not. Interestingly, different people can have their own narratives of the same problem. Every narrative is valid. While simple systems are often replicable and predictable, complex systems are self-organising and do not follow any given rules. Therefore, simple problems can be solved using a template that can be replicated from one situation to another. However, in case of complex problems, templatization does not work. Every problem is unique and requires unique approaches and highly situational perspectives.</p>
<p>In case of simple problems, our usual approach is to “solve” problems. In case of complex situations, we cannot just “solve” a problem, but we need to “resolve” the same. I avoid using the term “problem” and call it a “situation”. I rather ask who defines what a problem is. A situation may be called problematic by someone because of their own perspective and perspectives change from one person to another.</p>
<p>A systems interventionist approaches a situation with these aspects in mind and will essentially have three considerations. First, they will always look at boundaries critically. As for how we define boundaries is always subject to who is defining them based on their own understanding and perceptions. Consider the case above. Had Baahubali’s employer looked at drawing the boundary around sustainability and empowerment of the village, rather than just children’s education per se, they would have approached their CSR in very different manner. Second, the systems interventionist applies different methodologies and tools to approach the situation as they believe that multiple lenses will bring to the surface multiple nuances for the same situation. The company above would apply a range of tools to understand the situation and design the program that could lead to. The company above would apply a range of tools to understand the situation and design the program that could lead to the unearthing of the nuances of the village realities and address issues in a more substantial manner. The interventionist will be driven by a flexible mindset of evaluation and redesign, then just stopping a particular initiative if it did not show results. Third, a systems interventionist will always look for “betterment” of the situation – how the intervention can contribute towards the improvement of multiple stakeholders without compromising on the voices of the underprivileged. Baahubali’s employer would look for improvement of the village rather than just allocating funds for an activity. It would also institutionalise metrics that would look for holistic measurements and success parameters rather than tracking how many children are being educated year-on-year.</p>
<p>Systems thinking has inspired several methodologies over the years. These methodologies are handy for development workers through the life stages of design, implementation and measurement of interventions. Work in the development sector can be greatly benefitted by bringing into the fold approaches and methodologies inspired by systems thinking.</p>
<p>The next piece will talk about some of the approaches and methodologies that can be adopted for development projects and CSR.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="prose">
<p>On the eighteenth of May, Zomato was hacked. In no time, social media was adrift with questions over data security and financial threat to millions of users.</p>
<p>Pressing questions were raised against the poster-boy of Indian e-commerce over its ability to keep user data safe. The reputation of one of the most loved restaurant search and discovery platforms was under fire.</p>
<p>The threat posed by cybersecurity today is more than just security. It is about reputation.</p>
<p>Last year, Yahoo! admitted unearthing a major attack that affected at least five-hundred million accounts, which the company blamed on hackers working on behalf of a government. The sequence of events prompted Verizon Communication to think of withdrawing from an agreement to buy Yahoo!&#8217;s core internet business for nearly five-billion US Dollars.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we also saw a synchronized attack with hackers taking over control of every computer of three Indian banks and a pharmaceutical company and locked them. More recently, over three million debit cards were also exposed to high-risk because of breach in the networks of some of the leading Indian banks.</p>
<p>Hackers are actively pursuing potentially damaging information, ranging from financial data (customer and internal) to trade secrets, products in development, legal and personal data, controversial documents and more.</p>
<p>At an event of a cyberattack, organizations are vulnerable of encountering a wide variety of financial costs. However, the bigger damage is the breach of stakeholder trust and a serious dent on reputation.</p>
<p>Corporate reputation management is the safeguarding of a company’s most integral asset – Reputation. It involves shaping collective perceptions and attitudes about an organization through effective stakeholder engagement. Corporate reputation management can lead to a meaningful and productive relationship between an organization and the environment in which it operates.</p>
<p>Reputation management is a journey for the long haul and is deep rooted in the way companies engage with their stakeholders over a period of time. It is a continual process of influencing stakeholders to acknowledge, appreciate and absorb the foundational tenets of an organization. It helps enhance organizational value as perceived by stakeholders and mitigates negative impact in times of crisis.</p>
<p>As we start sharing more and more of some of our most private and sensitive information with digital platforms based on trust, the degree of our personal vulnerability also increases multi-fold. Organizations and institutions collecting and recording personal data for business operations need to be better equipped to handle their vulnerabilities in current times. This can be enabled by understanding its social, economic and policy-centric environment effectively. An organization needs to identify its stakeholders in this landscape and create multiple touch-points to understand them and engage with them over a period of time.</p>
<p>A pool of influencers in the public, including from its user base, need to be built who will stand by the company as champions in case of an adverse situation. Organizations also need to move away from the culture of secrecy around cyberattacks as most hacks or hacking attempts in India are tucked under the carpet and are not disclosed. This hinders information sharing between intelligence agencies and experts to track down the “dark web” in search of miscreants.</p>
<p>At a much larger level, India needs to tackle the massive problem with pirated software, with some reports claiming more than fifty-percent software used in the country to be unauthentic. This makes it even easier for cybercriminals to access and tamper with systems and networks. Awareness and education can play an important role here, keeping internal stakeholders as a priority cohort in the engagement strategy.</p>
<p>New regulations need to be introduced for the State to stay abreast of the new world of challenges and vulnerabilities being created by highly sophisticated cybercriminals. The IT Act of India was institutionalized way back in the year-2000. In the past years, realities have changed tremendously in terms of how users engage with computing and the revolutionary connectedness of devises that has set in. Several of the companies we see today have come with disruptive new-age business models, which often present surprises at the policy level. These companies need to make proactive efforts to reach out to the upper echelons of the State decision making and bring about awareness and education about their businesses, the threats they face, and how effective policies can support them.</p>
<p>The threat of a cybersecurity breach and its impact on corporate reputation is arguably <em>the</em> issue keeping the C-Suite up at night—and it will likely be the top issue for years to come.</p>
<p>Reputation of an organization is hinged strongly on what it communicates, to who it communicates to, and where it communicates as much as its ability to adapt to response and feedback from its stakeholders. This makes it a cyclical, continual cycle.</p>
<p>Keeping cybersecurity in mind, organizations need to adopt a concerted effort to understand and address this threat in a focused and diligent manner.</p>
<p>Start with being <em>prepared</em>. Cybercriminals are increasingly getting more sophisticated in their attack pattern of venting, organizing, mobilizing and boating. Organizations need to be ahead of the curve to monitor this “deep web” with data, information and intuition to counter a breach and communicate during an attack progression. In addition, the organization needs to be prepared in the event a hacker is successful, for which you need to invest in scenario planning, communication channels and response mechanisms.</p>
<p>In case a breach occurs, you need to <em>manage</em> it effectively and with speed. A crisis management and communication team needs to be well strongly in place to respond and navigate through the chaos that comes in at the time of a cyberattack. There are two aspects that need to be addressed in such situations – countering the attack and managing the communication. Both requires information to be churned out and analysed in real-time. This is where your champions in the stakeholder universe will count the most.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>restoration</em>. The post-breach process needs to be directed to restore confidence in the organization and rebuild the corporate reputation. You may get the impression that this is a sequential final stage, but this actually flows through the entire process right from the time a cyberattack breaks out. Transparency and frequency is at the crux of this communication. The stronger the engagement and trust has been in the stakeholder universe, the quicker the turnaround is expected to be.</p>
<p>Safeguarding corporate reputation in the cyberage needs a holistic understanding and approach. Organizations need to be ahead of the curve at all times making sure we are equipped to prepare, manage and restore. Proactive stakeholder engagement can go a long way in equipping the organization achieve the same.</p>

<h4 class="big_article_summary"><strong><i>A startup that does not understand its ecosystem players and their impact could well be caught on the wrong foot by making crucial business decisions with incomplete information.</i></strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The environment that a startup today operates in is dynamic and intertwined with various dimensions &#8211; social, economic and political &#8211; resulting in a complex web of realities. Understanding the environment leads us to appreciate market realities. Appreciation of market realities leads us to arrive at insights to navigate through it better. In the social environment, startups need to understand stakeholder behavior, demographic and psychographic. Similarly in the economic environment, macroeconomic and microeconomic factors and market externalities need to be appreciated. Finally, in the political environment, sectoral policy, startup business support and government schemes need to be understood and leveraged for success of the organization.</p>
<p>A startup that does not understand its ecosystem players and their impact could well be caught on the wrong foot by making crucial business decisions with incomplete information. The marketplace is rapidly becoming a global one, which means the geopolitical landscape that a company has to keep tabs on has expanded exponentially. A marketplace with fading borders means that that local economies are susceptible to the butterfly effect where relatively small events in one area can result in large effects in faraway places; political or financial events in other countries or regions could result in disturbances to the local ecosystem that may not be immediately obvious but could affect the startup in unanticipated ways.</p>
<p>For instance, whilst there was a phase of propaganda against Chinese goods during the festive Diwali season of 2016, it cannot be ignored that some of the biggest startups in India are funded by Chinese funds. Didi Chuxing, the company that bested Uber in China, has invested in Indian cab service company Ola and Chinese internet giant Tencent has invested heavily in in the Indian messenger app Hike as well as healthcare company Practo. Indian companies have been acquired by Chinese companies as well. This is an example where we see the social, economic and political environments inextricably interlinked.</p>
<p>The market realities we exist in today are constantly evolving and are becoming increasingly unpredictable. In such an environment, it is important for organizations to be agile and resilient in how they respond and react to their external environments.</p>
<p>As we navigate through these dynamic market realities, what has stayed constant over the last multiple decades is the importance of a company to create and sustain a reputation that fosters a positive relationship with all its stakeholders. Embracing a holistic approach to public relations encompassing aspects to touch stakeholders beyond pure media vehicle is most important.</p>
<p>Startups, especially as they incubate, tend to narrow-focus on building their product or service, but it is important to stay aware of their ecosystem and market dynamics that affect them. They may mistakenly assume that public relations building and stakeholder engagement can come later “when they are successful”. There have been examples of startups that had an exciting initial trajectory but were soon derailed because they did not understand the importance of reputation in their stakeholders’ view; one startup had its in-fighting made public in an ugly manner and another had to deal with a founder being accused of insider trading. The last two years have also seen a tepid momentum in the startup ecosystem in the country with mounting losses for some of the largest e-commerce players due to overspending on marketing, advertising and discounting. At the close of the year-2016, The Financial Express reported e-commerce companies in India like Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm contributing for 70% of the total loss of INR 10,670 crore that the industry has been hit with. This has led to decreased investor and analyst confidence leading to the long term damage of several known companies in their expansion and stabilization phases. The important takeaway is the focus that needs to be directed to get the fundamentals of sustainable business in place before over-focusing on external branding and communication; hence the need to work diligently on building long-term reputation rather than a short-term image.</p>
<p>While these companies may eventually recover from the hits they took, an awareness of the importance of public relations and strategic communications, pillared on firming their reputation, would have helped avoid or at least mitigate the negativity.</p>
<p>The success startups seek is hinged on this very relationship with the stakeholders — including investors, prospective employees, communities, agencies, analysts and customers — which in turn builds goodwill with the publics.</p>
<p>Only a robust stakeholder engagement strategy can support startups navigate towards building successful institutions in the twenty first century market realities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grand Bazaar, or Al-Madina Souk of Istanbul, is one of the world’s oldest, most crowded, difficult to navigate, claustrophobic marketplaces.</p>
<p>Narrow alleys, 4500 plus shops, with 2,500 plus connecting rooms, a mosque, 19 fountains, several squares, 18 gates, shopkeepers, street sellers of different services, con-artists, and anything between 250,000 to 400,000 visitors, every single day!</p>
<p>It goes without saying that few people come here to buy anything in particular.</p>
<p>Why then, do 91,250,000 odd tourists flock here every year?</p>
<p>Well, they come here for the ‘experience’.</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve clothed experience in different garbs and watched it through different lenses. While all along, time and again, experience has been calling out for recognition.</p>
<p>Finally, the layers of the glass onion have peeled, and time has come to raise a toast to the value of a great experience.</p>
<p><strong>Experience – a 21<sup>st</sup> century market reality</strong></p>
<p>The 21<sup>st</sup> century market environment is much like the Al-Madina Souk. Visitors here include Flower Children, Baby Boomers, GenX, Millennials and the iGen. It is a market that believes it is entitled to great experiences. It also is a market which doesn’t make room for second chances.</p>
<p>This market is fuelled by technology. The close bond between customer experience and technology is one of the key realities of this digitally connected space, where you are just-one-click-away-from-your-heart’s-desire.</p>
<p>So, here’s a look at some rules that will determine whether you navigate this market, or get lost forever.</p>
<p>&#8211; Technology is the strategic asset that will enable a fluid engagement between people, processes and products.</p>
<p>&#8211; Technology cannot be ‘a’ department in your company. It must be the fuel of every department.</p>
<p>&#8211; Experience drives engagement and determines loyalty.</p>
<p>&#8211; Your vision must be to deliver a complete and positive customer experience.</p>
<p>&#8211; Multiple devices are today’s order.</p>
<p>&#8211;  Multiple experiences through a single device tops in the race for space</p>
<p>&#8211; Experiences must be delivered across devices and geared to lean towards hand-held, anytime, anywhere devices.</p>
<p>Almost on every count, experience rules the roost. Let’s face it, folks &#8211; experience has always called the shots. It always will.</p>
