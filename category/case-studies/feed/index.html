				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram:  Inspiring pride</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is the primary civic agency which provides the residents of Gurugram with civic services. These include  maintenance of parks, drains, public toilets and other public places, property tax collection, application for trade licenses, registration of marriages, births and deaths, construction and maintenance of municipal markets, fire brigade services, solid waste management and planting of trees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The authorities at MCG were finding it hard to implement their directives in Gurugram, as the residents weren’t being cooperative. Things came to a head when the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs conducted a Swachh Survekshan Survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign was very well received. The posts, videos and jingles were liked and shared by a large audience and received much appreciation.  In fact, some of the posts were even retweeted and reposted by Swachh Survekshan Urban, Swachh Bharat Mission and other prominent bodies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">MCG roped in The PRactice to spread the message of hygiene and cleanliness, and to inspire pride in the neighbourhood. A study of the problem showed that the residents weren’t convinced about MCG’s efficiency. We realised that MCG was in dire need of <b>Reputation Management. </b>It needed to be perceived as efficient and responsive.  To achieve our objective, we adopted a 360-degree approach and incorporated elements from our integrated offerings including <b>Strategic Media Relations, Digital Engagement </b>and on-ground activation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our press releases on Swachh Survekshan received 20+ coverages and accounted for almost 60% of tier 1 publications. In addition, we designed social media campaigns through which we involved larger audiences, leaders and influencers in Gurugram to promote cleanliness in the city and participate in Swachh Survekshan.  As part of our</p>
<p><b>Stakeholder Engagement</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">programme, we identified various stakeholder cohorts comprising local influencers. We created a bilingual communication campaign using jingles, posters, social media posts, cartoons, etc to ensure public participation. The campaign was very well received. The posts, videos and jingles were liked and shared by a large audience and received much appreciation.  In fact, some of the posts were even retweeted and reposted by Swachh Survekshan Urban, Swachh Bharat Mission and other prominent bodies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Adelaide, Kangaroo Island and Barossa in South Australia are not commonly considered as holiday destinations for Indians. Awareness of this region was amplified when Adelaide hosted the India vs Pakistan match during the ICC World Cup 2015. The challenge before The Practice was: To leverage the momentum from the World Cup match to drive more  visitors to South Australian destinations and to position the region as a destination of choice for Indian tourists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of our sustained online strategy attracted a 71 per cent increase in fans, 18X spike in organic reach and a 10X jump  in organic engagement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At first, we developed a message map, which helped us to zero in on unique offerings of five key destinations. Under our <b>Strategic Media Relations program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we drew on opportunities like the shooting of a popular Hindi TV series at Adelaide, Baross and Kangaroo Island</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to attract arrivals; and announcements of SATC investment programs in India to target trade and financial media. In two years, we had organized 11 familiarization trips for the media, which included </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Geographic Traveller </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Times Life</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our strategic brand positioning solution translated into 170 stories for our client garnering over 1.4 billion impressions and AUD 8 million in PR value. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our <b>Stakeholder Engagement program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on deploying key social media influencers in the lifestyle and cricket space to reach our target audience comprising of honeymooners, independent travellers and cricket enthusiasts. We executed three influencer campaigns over two years, which led to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">30-50k likes per post and over 400 million media impressions. The main objective of our </span><b>Digital Engagement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign was to boost engagement for each post on the official South Australia Facebook page in India.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of our sustained online strategy attracted a 71 per cent increase in fans, 18X spike in organic reach and a 10X jump  in organic engagement.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013, Altigreen is in the business of accelerating a customer’s smooth transition to  an all electric or hybrid electric vehicle through their indigenously developed full technology stack. Being a new market concept and a startup, Altigreen required a strong push to get conversations started in this space.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The client approached The PRactice in the winter of 2016, when Delhi’s dilemma with smog and rising pollution was at its peak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy was executed by driving a narrative around Altigreen’s journey as a startup and through crafted messaging on an innovative green brand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Our Strategic Media Relations program </b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">pursued an approach which capitalized on the relevancy of the brand solution in the light of heightened concerns about the environment. This strategy was executed by driving a narrative around Altigreen’s journey as a startup and through crafted messaging on an innovative green brand. This messaging had to resonate with all the stakeholders in the space. We were able to galvanise interest about the category and the brand in the media leading to a successful outcome:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a matter of six months, the PRactice had generated successful high impact stories in 18 Tier 1 mainline publications and electronic media such as ET, CNBC, TV 18, HBO etc. Efforts are now on to establish a thought leadership positioning for the brand in the extremely relevant yet less explored landscape of green mobility.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The objective of the Second Bihar Innovation Forum was to achieve social &amp; economic empowerment of the rural poor in Bihar. In 2013, the client wanted to drive a communication campaign that would reach out to impactful social innovators from public, private and civil society organizations registered in India, and invite them to participate in the Second Bihar Innovation Forum (BIF2).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">BIF2 had identified eight livelihood themes &#8211; Agriculture, livestock, financial services, rural energy, ICT based solution, skill development &amp; non-farm sector, access to public entitlements and access to services.  Participants were to come up with income generating solutions, within these themes. These solutions aimed to provide the rural folk of Bihar with a reason to stay on in the state and prevent migration to towns and cities, where they go to seek a livelihood.</p>
<blockquote><p>The campaign drew desired media visibility and a rush of activity on the website.  As an outcome, around 500 innovators submitted their applications for the Second Bihar Innovation Forum.</p></blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice designed a communication program that showcased the potential of the state and educated high impact investors about the support from the government and World Bank. We wanted to convince innovators to roll out their businesses in Bihar and create livelihood opportunities for its residents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign drew desired media visibility and a rush of activity on the website.  As an outcome, around 500 innovators submitted their applications for the Second Bihar Innovation Forum. It was indeed a resounding success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Instamojo is India’s first full-stack transactional platform for MSMEs. A blend of technology, data, design and ‘little bit of Mojo’, Instamojo makes it possible for small entrepreneurs from tier 2 and tier 3 towns to start an online store, and easily accept payments with just a mere link. In spite of being the pioneer of on-demand payments in India, Instamojo, faced a challenge due to the lack of differentiation among the media, between payment gateways and on-demand payments. Furthermore, the company had low awareness and recall among its stakeholders when compared to players such as PayPal and RazorPay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice got onboard and recommended a <b>Strategic Media Relations  </b>solution to address the client’s challenges. Our solution positioned Instamojo as a category inventor by highlighting its distinct value proposition and establishing the company as a trusted partner for small businesses. We recommended that the client build <b>Media Relations </b>to showcase how Instamojo championed the growth of small businesses through its suite of solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a direct impact of our focussed and rigorous approach, there was better understanding of Instamojo’s value proposition among key journalists. This in turn resulted in <b>145x</b> increase in visibility for Instamojo among standalone and industry stories around the MSMEs, Fintech and the payments space</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our media outreach programme comprised relationship building meetings, increasing Instamojo&#8217;s participation in relevant industry stories and participation in key industry awards/events. As a direct impact of our focussed and rigorous approach, there was better understanding of Instamojo’s value proposition among key journalists. This in turn resulted in <b>145x </b>increase in visibility for Instamojo among standalone and industry stories around the MSMEs, Fintech and the payments space. The PRactice placed high-impact stories in The Economic Times, Business Standard, Business Today, Forbes, Bloomberg Quint, Mint, VC Circle. We also leveraged our electronic media relationships to secure opportunities with marquee television shows such as &#8216;Young Turks&#8217; on CNBC TV18 and &#8216;Leaders of Tomorrow&#8217; along with ‘By the Way’ on ET Now. We established thought leadership for the founder, Sampad Swain, through participation in key industry events and awards such as TechSparks, India Fintech Awards, Business World Fintech Summit and Business World 40 Under 40 Achievers. In short, The PRactice built a strong voice for Instamojo among its different stakeholders.</p>

</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We began our partnership with Netradyne with Message Mapping, our messaging architecture that keeps the various stakeholders in mind and reaches out to them with relevant information about the company, the leadership,  the technology and the product. We developed <b>Strategic Media Relations </b>plan and invited key  journalists to have a preview of the technology even before the launch. We developed relationships with mainstream and auto-media and led with an industry category sensitization approach. We successfully positioned the company as a dynamic start-up, pioneering road safety solutions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As an outcome of our interactions, key journalists are now aware of the road safety challenge and Netradyne’s AI solution. Media perceives Netradyne as a thought leader in this completely new space of technology for automotive safety.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XPRIZE is one of the world’s biggest facilitators of radical innovations that have the potential to bring about exponential change.</p>
<p>XPRIZE incentivizes solutions for challenges that are audacious, yet achievable. The non-profit organization planned to launch two of its prizes &#8211; Anu and Naveen Jain Women’s Safety XPRIZE and Water Abundance XPRIZE in India. The challenge was that India was a unique, diverse and unchartered territory for the client.</p>
<p>XPRIZE partnered with The PRactice to build awareness of the challenges in India, and encourage Indian and global teams to participate. We designed an integrated <strong>Brand Communication</strong> strategy. This included <strong>Strategic Media Relations</strong>,<strong> Digital Engagement</strong>, <strong>Content Development</strong> and <strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>. We engaged with the media extensively and it payed off in the form of great coverage in traditional, regional, new age and digital media. We used existing social media properties to run a campaign that highlighted women’s safety and water scarcity issues and roped in various stakeholder comprising individuals and organizations who believed in making a difference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an outcome of our integrated strategy, India ranked second (after US) in terms of maximum registered applications for both the prizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The extensive publicity, wide print and digital media coverage, interviews, discussions, meetings and created brand recall which led to the desired response. 85 teams registered for the Women Safety XPRIZE of which 20 Teams were from India. 98 teams registered for the Water Abundance XPRIZE of which 11 Teams were from India. As an outcome of our integrated strategy, India ranked second (after US) in terms of maximum registered applications for both the prizes.</p>

The Handloom School (THS) is a non-profit organization born of the need to preserve India’s handloom industry which is under threat. When power looms were introduced and mass-produced textiles became more commercially viable, they grabbed a huge market share.  Unfortunately, this spelt doom for the traditional handloom weavers of India. Many weavers started looking at alternate livelihoods. Handloom weaving became a dying art. THS intervened and developed a specialized education program for young weavers. The idea was to bring handloom weavers back to the fold and to bridge the gap between traditional weaving and new competencies. </p>
<p>
To get recognition for this program, THS had to promote its case to relevant stakeholders and get their support.  THS identified The PRactice as the perfect partner to reach out to people and organizations who could further the cause. </p>
<blockquote><p>The organic, no-marketing-dollars-spent Social Media campaign was hugely liked by readers and the engagement grew by 800%. The weavers of The Handloom School received orders worth Rs.13 lakhs during the fashion week. </p></blockquote>
<p>
As part of our Stakeholder Engagement program, we identified  The Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) as a key influencer and made a pitch to promote handloom weaves from Maheshwar. The Director of FDCI was convinced by our pitch and THS was offered complimentary participation in the Amazon India Fashion Week (AIFW), 2017. We went the extra mile and initiated a parallel tie-up with Good Earth who agreed to sponsor the event. The collection was presented at Amazon Fashion Week, as the lead ramp show on March 15th, 2017. </p>
<p>
Our strategy included <b>Message Development, Strategic Media Relations, Digital Engagement, Communication Design and Stakeholder Engagement </b> as solutions. The outcome was incredible. Leading publications carried detailed stories about India’s unique handloom art. Over 98 lakh impressions were generated! The organic, no-marketing-dollars-spent Social Media campaign was hugely liked by readers and the engagement grew by 800%. As a result of the activities, awareness grew, and the weavers of The Handloom School received orders worth Rs.13 lakhs during the fashion week. What’s more,  the WomenWeave Charitable Trust also worked with us to launch of a collection of handwoven textiles.</p>

Siemens, a global engineering group, approached The PRactice to strengthen their position in industrial digitalization, automation and electrification space within the Indian industry. The task was to reinforce and amplify their competencies in these areas; to magnify their new agile, Industry 4.0 identity.  The company wanted to be more aligned to the digital revolution transforming industry worldwide.</p>
<blockquote><p> Over the course of a year, the spotlight of the discourses around Siemens shifted to digitalization, and consequently, their share of voice in the industry spiked as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>The PRactice opted for the <b>Corporate Reputation Management</b> program that was aimed at generating awareness about Siemens’ strategic offerings in industrial digitalization. This was achieved by collaborating closely with their in-house communications team to engage with a select group of journalists. The focus was on CAT-A publications, and long-format pieces that comprehensively captured the messaging on Digitalization. The first Siemens Innovation Day held in India was also leveraged to garner high-impact stories in prominent financial, mainline and trade publications.</p>
<p>
Over the course of a year, the spotlight of the discourses around Siemens shifted to digitalization, and consequently, their share of voice in the industry spiked as well. Besides this impact, a sharply focused <b>Strategic Media Relations</b> engagement plan led to brand affinity among key journalists, making Siemens a preferred choice for story inputs around digitalization and other issues surrounding Indian industry. This resulted in successfully reinforcing their transformation and leadership in the field of digitalization.</p>

Smile Train India is an international children’s charity, which provides free cleft surgeries and comprehensive cleft care to children across India. The challenges were two-fold: they wanted to accentuate awareness about cleft deformity and its impact on an individual and their family and launch fund-raising efforts to eventually make their India program self-sustainable.</p>
<blockquote><p>The relevant media coverage we achieved evoked an 80 per cent share of voice across media channels during a high-profile event involving actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Our <b>Strategic Media Relations program</b> focused on building visibility for Smile Train across all channels including lifestyle magazines, financials, mainlines and vernaculars by mobilizing a network of supporters including Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Sanjiv Bajaj, Deepa Malik and others. The relevant media coverage we achieved evoked an 80 per cent share of voice across media channels during a high-profile event involving actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.</p>
<p>
To initiate and sustain fundraising efforts, we deployed our <b>Digital Engagement program</b> to plan and execute digital campaigns on Facebook, Twitter and Google adwords to amplify conversations around clefts, and to promote the ad campaigns on donations to tap new donors. The outcome was positive: we raised funds, and Smile Train India also started to enjoy generous donations from dormant donors along with appreciation mails.</p>
