				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram:  Inspiring pride</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is the primary civic agency which provides the residents of Gurugram with civic services. These include  maintenance of parks, drains, public toilets and other public places, property tax collection, application for trade licenses, registration of marriages, births and deaths, construction and maintenance of municipal markets, fire brigade services, solid waste management and planting of trees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The authorities at MCG were finding it hard to implement their directives in Gurugram, as the residents weren’t being cooperative. Things came to a head when the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs conducted a Swachh Survekshan Survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign was very well received. The posts, videos and jingles were liked and shared by a large audience and received much appreciation.  In fact, some of the posts were even retweeted and reposted by Swachh Survekshan Urban, Swachh Bharat Mission and other prominent bodies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">MCG roped in The PRactice to spread the message of hygiene and cleanliness, and to inspire pride in the neighbourhood. A study of the problem showed that the residents weren’t convinced about MCG’s efficiency. We realised that MCG was in dire need of <b>Reputation Management. </b>It needed to be perceived as efficient and responsive.  To achieve our objective, we adopted a 360-degree approach and incorporated elements from our integrated offerings including <b>Strategic Media Relations, Digital Engagement </b>and on-ground activation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our press releases on Swachh Survekshan received 20+ coverages and accounted for almost 60% of tier 1 publications. In addition, we designed social media campaigns through which we involved larger audiences, leaders and influencers in Gurugram to promote cleanliness in the city and participate in Swachh Survekshan.  As part of our</p>
<p><b>Stakeholder Engagement</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">programme, we identified various stakeholder cohorts comprising local influencers. We created a bilingual communication campaign using jingles, posters, social media posts, cartoons, etc to ensure public participation. The campaign was very well received. The posts, videos and jingles were liked and shared by a large audience and received much appreciation.  In fact, some of the posts were even retweeted and reposted by Swachh Survekshan Urban, Swachh Bharat Mission and other prominent bodies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The objective of the Second Bihar Innovation Forum was to achieve social &amp; economic empowerment of the rural poor in Bihar. In 2013, the client wanted to drive a communication campaign that would reach out to impactful social innovators from public, private and civil society organizations registered in India, and invite them to participate in the Second Bihar Innovation Forum (BIF2).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">BIF2 had identified eight livelihood themes &#8211; Agriculture, livestock, financial services, rural energy, ICT based solution, skill development &amp; non-farm sector, access to public entitlements and access to services.  Participants were to come up with income generating solutions, within these themes. These solutions aimed to provide the rural folk of Bihar with a reason to stay on in the state and prevent migration to towns and cities, where they go to seek a livelihood.</p>
<blockquote><p>The campaign drew desired media visibility and a rush of activity on the website.  As an outcome, around 500 innovators submitted their applications for the Second Bihar Innovation Forum.</p></blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice designed a communication program that showcased the potential of the state and educated high impact investors about the support from the government and World Bank. We wanted to convince innovators to roll out their businesses in Bihar and create livelihood opportunities for its residents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign drew desired media visibility and a rush of activity on the website.  As an outcome, around 500 innovators submitted their applications for the Second Bihar Innovation Forum. It was indeed a resounding success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XPRIZE is one of the world’s biggest facilitators of radical innovations that have the potential to bring about exponential change.</p>
<p>XPRIZE incentivizes solutions for challenges that are audacious, yet achievable. The non-profit organization planned to launch two of its prizes &#8211; Anu and Naveen Jain Women’s Safety XPRIZE and Water Abundance XPRIZE in India. The challenge was that India was a unique, diverse and unchartered territory for the client.</p>
<p>XPRIZE partnered with The PRactice to build awareness of the challenges in India, and encourage Indian and global teams to participate. We designed an integrated <strong>Brand Communication</strong> strategy. This included <strong>Strategic Media Relations</strong>,<strong> Digital Engagement</strong>, <strong>Content Development</strong> and <strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>. We engaged with the media extensively and it payed off in the form of great coverage in traditional, regional, new age and digital media. We used existing social media properties to run a campaign that highlighted women’s safety and water scarcity issues and roped in various stakeholder comprising individuals and organizations who believed in making a difference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an outcome of our integrated strategy, India ranked second (after US) in terms of maximum registered applications for both the prizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The extensive publicity, wide print and digital media coverage, interviews, discussions, meetings and created brand recall which led to the desired response. 85 teams registered for the Women Safety XPRIZE of which 20 Teams were from India. 98 teams registered for the Water Abundance XPRIZE of which 11 Teams were from India. As an outcome of our integrated strategy, India ranked second (after US) in terms of maximum registered applications for both the prizes.</p>

Smile Train India is an international children’s charity, which provides free cleft surgeries and comprehensive cleft care to children across India. The challenges were two-fold: they wanted to accentuate awareness about cleft deformity and its impact on an individual and their family and launch fund-raising efforts to eventually make their India program self-sustainable.</p>
<blockquote><p>The relevant media coverage we achieved evoked an 80 per cent share of voice across media channels during a high-profile event involving actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Our <b>Strategic Media Relations program</b> focused on building visibility for Smile Train across all channels including lifestyle magazines, financials, mainlines and vernaculars by mobilizing a network of supporters including Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Sanjiv Bajaj, Deepa Malik and others. The relevant media coverage we achieved evoked an 80 per cent share of voice across media channels during a high-profile event involving actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.</p>
<p>
To initiate and sustain fundraising efforts, we deployed our <b>Digital Engagement program</b> to plan and execute digital campaigns on Facebook, Twitter and Google adwords to amplify conversations around clefts, and to promote the ad campaigns on donations to tap new donors. The outcome was positive: we raised funds, and Smile Train India also started to enjoy generous donations from dormant donors along with appreciation mails.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Infosys Science Foundation (ISF) is a non-profit trust which was set up in February 2009. As a part of its initiatives, the Foundation instituted the Infosys Prize to honour outstanding achievements in science and research in India, and to inspire young Indians to choose a vocation in research.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual award</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> honours outstanding achievements across six categories: Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, Engineering and Computer Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Humanities and Life Sciences. The award for each category carries a prize of INR 65 lakh. The jury comprises eminent leaders in each of these fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the launch of the prize, as a strategic public relations partner, The PRactice team focused on building the narrative about the importance and need for science and research in India first, and then went on to motivate the community further, at the launch event</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a three pronged campaign. We started by briefing the top tier journalists covering science and technology beats about ISF and how we aimed to usher in change in the scientific world. Next, we had direct interactions with the media across the country. And finally, we identified relevant Op-Ed opportunities for long-term sustainability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team also hosted a debate on the status of science and research in India, and explained how the Infosys Prize would influence the ecosystem. A press conference announced the winners. The PRactice also tapped leading publications to cover the conferences and spread excitement about the event across the country. The extensive outreach via print media featured the winners in key cities and their hometowns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a key takeaway from these activities, there was new interest in the culture of science and research. The event was one of the most talked about topics in the industry. Our contribution to the campaign was greatly appreciated by our client and by the end recipients – the scientific community.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United Way Bengaluru (UWBe), one of Bangalore&#8217;s leading non-profit organisations, wanted to organise a unique event to bring together the most important stakeholders of the city &#8211; its denizens. The organisation chose the picturesque Nandi Hills as the locale and The PRactice took on the challenge of organising a first-of-its-kind Hillathon where participants would run a verdant and hilly course to raise funds for a local cause of their choice.</p>
<p>The team had less than a month to bring this fund -”racing” event to life.  Participants could choose the course &#8211; a 6 km Heritage walk or an endurance-challenging half marathon. It was decided that the funds raised from the event will go to different charitable cause selected by participants and not by the organiser.</p>
<p>Under the team’s creative onslaught, the Nandi Hillathon campaign began to take shape. The PRactice team doubled up to work with media channels, both local and national, to garner the widest possible exposure for this citizen initiative. In addition to highlighting the event itself, the media stories focused on local causes, participation of transgenders, and citizen champions in the Hillathon. Local celebrities were enlisted and their familiar presence was leveraged to spread awareness about the event and its mission. The event was listed on Milaap, India’s leading crowdfunding site for social causes, as well as every other city-specific event listings. Meanwhile, creative use of engaging videos, contest campaigns and hashtags were used to create buzz on social media.</p>
<p>The team also undertook a sustained influencer outreach and connected with Bengaluru-based running, fitness and hiking  groups, as well as groups focused on supporting local activities in the city. The team reached out to Corporates, NGOs and Resident Welfare Associations (RWA) to underscore Nandi Hillathon&#8217;s mission to address issues that are dear to most Bengalurians, like restoring biodiversity to Nandi Hills and cleaning up the badly polluted  lakes in the city.</p>
<p>All the hard work and resourcefulness paid off!</p>
<p>The event was a resounding success with over 600 participants. It received 64 stories including 6 in regional television coverage. A leading publication carried a detailed print story about the event and its mission. Curated interactions with leaders of the transgender community resulted in 2 high impact feature stories. The digital outreach on social media [organic and paid] resulted in nearly 200,000 impressions.</p>
<p>The UWBe team was extremely impressed and appreciative of The PRactice&#8217;s contributions.</p>
<p><strong><em> “We were lucky to partner with The PRactice.The team was a delight to work with! There were no dearth of ideas and action from their side&#8230; The team understood us completely and despite the less than 35 day deadline, did an amazing job. We loved the professionalism displayed by the team and their execution efficiency at each stage. We are glad that this partnership worked and look forward to having them on board for our various projects.”</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><span style="color: #800080;">Mahyco or Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company Pvt Ltd is India’s first GM technology company. Dedicated to providing a technological solution to the agrarian problems of the country, Mahyco is a 50 year old pioneer in the field of agriculture.</span></h5>
<p><span id="more-3122"></span></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges faced by Mahyco is that of the strong opposition against Genetically Modified and Hybrid seeds in the country, with no policies to support field trials.</p>
<p>The PRactice initiated an integrated communications campaign for Mahyco which focused on relationship building with stakeholders and third party advocates. We leveraged strategic media relations, digital engagement and build content collaterals to help build a balanced view towards technology in Agriculture.</p>
<p>We started a bi-annual publication ‘Beej’ which provided a platform to further engage the stakeholders through articles and opinions for everyone to read. View the <a href="http://mahyco.com/knowledgezone/beej">Beej inaugural Issue on mahyco.com</a></p>
<p>Over the last few years, these efforts have resulted in balanced and informative news articles and balanced perceptions.</p>
