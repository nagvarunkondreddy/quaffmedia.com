				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013, Altigreen is in the business of accelerating a customer’s smooth transition to  an all electric or hybrid electric vehicle through their indigenously developed full technology stack. Being a new market concept and a startup, Altigreen required a strong push to get conversations started in this space.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The client approached The PRactice in the winter of 2016, when Delhi’s dilemma with smog and rising pollution was at its peak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy was executed by driving a narrative around Altigreen’s journey as a startup and through crafted messaging on an innovative green brand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Our Strategic Media Relations program </b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">pursued an approach which capitalized on the relevancy of the brand solution in the light of heightened concerns about the environment. This strategy was executed by driving a narrative around Altigreen’s journey as a startup and through crafted messaging on an innovative green brand. This messaging had to resonate with all the stakeholders in the space. We were able to galvanise interest about the category and the brand in the media leading to a successful outcome:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a matter of six months, the PRactice had generated successful high impact stories in 18 Tier 1 mainline publications and electronic media such as ET, CNBC, TV 18, HBO etc. Efforts are now on to establish a thought leadership positioning for the brand in the extremely relevant yet less explored landscape of green mobility.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Instamojo is India’s first full-stack transactional platform for MSMEs. A blend of technology, data, design and ‘little bit of Mojo’, Instamojo makes it possible for small entrepreneurs from tier 2 and tier 3 towns to start an online store, and easily accept payments with just a mere link. In spite of being the pioneer of on-demand payments in India, Instamojo, faced a challenge due to the lack of differentiation among the media, between payment gateways and on-demand payments. Furthermore, the company had low awareness and recall among its stakeholders when compared to players such as PayPal and RazorPay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice got onboard and recommended a <b>Strategic Media Relations  </b>solution to address the client’s challenges. Our solution positioned Instamojo as a category inventor by highlighting its distinct value proposition and establishing the company as a trusted partner for small businesses. We recommended that the client build <b>Media Relations </b>to showcase how Instamojo championed the growth of small businesses through its suite of solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a direct impact of our focussed and rigorous approach, there was better understanding of Instamojo’s value proposition among key journalists. This in turn resulted in <b>145x</b> increase in visibility for Instamojo among standalone and industry stories around the MSMEs, Fintech and the payments space</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our media outreach programme comprised relationship building meetings, increasing Instamojo&#8217;s participation in relevant industry stories and participation in key industry awards/events. As a direct impact of our focussed and rigorous approach, there was better understanding of Instamojo’s value proposition among key journalists. This in turn resulted in <b>145x </b>increase in visibility for Instamojo among standalone and industry stories around the MSMEs, Fintech and the payments space. The PRactice placed high-impact stories in The Economic Times, Business Standard, Business Today, Forbes, Bloomberg Quint, Mint, VC Circle. We also leveraged our electronic media relationships to secure opportunities with marquee television shows such as &#8216;Young Turks&#8217; on CNBC TV18 and &#8216;Leaders of Tomorrow&#8217; along with ‘By the Way’ on ET Now. We established thought leadership for the founder, Sampad Swain, through participation in key industry events and awards such as TechSparks, India Fintech Awards, Business World Fintech Summit and Business World 40 Under 40 Achievers. In short, The PRactice built a strong voice for Instamojo among its different stakeholders.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Netradyne develops ground-breaking solutions using AI and Deep Learning to improve driver safety and road safety. It is one of the first companies to have developed a robust product combining these two technologies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The PRactice is creating awareness of  the company’s expertise in this niche area . We are building Netradyne’s reputation as a leader in this relatively new space of automotive safety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We developed relationships with mainstream and auto-media and led with an industry category sensitization approach. We successfully positioned the company as a dynamic start-up, pioneering road safety solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We began our partnership with Netradyne with Message Mapping, our messaging architecture that keeps the various stakeholders in mind and reaches out to them with relevant information about the company, the leadership,  the technology and the product. We developed <b>Strategic Media Relations </b>plan and invited key  journalists to have a preview of the technology even before the launch. We developed relationships with mainstream and auto-media and led with an industry category sensitization approach. We successfully positioned the company as a dynamic start-up, pioneering road safety solutions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As an outcome of our interactions, key journalists are now aware of the road safety challenge and Netradyne’s AI solution. Media perceives Netradyne as a thought leader in this completely new space of technology for automotive safety.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
Siemens, a global engineering group, approached The PRactice to strengthen their position in industrial digitalization, automation and electrification space within the Indian industry. The task was to reinforce and amplify their competencies in these areas; to magnify their new agile, Industry 4.0 identity.  The company wanted to be more aligned to the digital revolution transforming industry worldwide.</p>
<blockquote><p> Over the course of a year, the spotlight of the discourses around Siemens shifted to digitalization, and consequently, their share of voice in the industry spiked as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>The PRactice opted for the <b>Corporate Reputation Management</b> program that was aimed at generating awareness about Siemens’ strategic offerings in industrial digitalization. This was achieved by collaborating closely with their in-house communications team to engage with a select group of journalists. The focus was on CAT-A publications, and long-format pieces that comprehensively captured the messaging on Digitalization. The first Siemens Innovation Day held in India was also leveraged to garner high-impact stories in prominent financial, mainline and trade publications.</p>
<p>
Over the course of a year, the spotlight of the discourses around Siemens shifted to digitalization, and consequently, their share of voice in the industry spiked as well. Besides this impact, a sharply focused <b>Strategic Media Relations</b> engagement plan led to brand affinity among key journalists, making Siemens a preferred choice for story inputs around digitalization and other issues surrounding Indian industry. This resulted in successfully reinforcing their transformation and leadership in the field of digitalization.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amadeus Labs, a global IT solutions provider for the travel industry, faced the challenge of attracting and retaining the best engineering talent in the country due to fierce competition from established IT brands in India, including Google, Microsoft, Facebook etc. The ask therefore was to build a strong brand equity among the leading engineering institutes and among senior executives in India to spotlight the pro-employee work culture.  We had to articulate this message through compelling communication strategies that resonate with the target audience on relevant platforms.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Thirty initiatives around employee engagement were executed in 24 months including a POSH (prevention of sexual harassment) program; a monthly newsletter Disruption Chronicles, The aGeek series, and others.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the outset, we studied the technology and employee landscape and accordingly ideated activities that resulted in maximum engagement. Subsequently, The PRactice rolled out a comprehensive </span><b>Stakeholder Engagement program  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">encompassing approaches to reach key stakeholders via content and design elements. The messaging pertained to employee benefits, engagement initiatives, rewards and recognition, workplace diversity etc.  Thirty initiatives around employee engagement were executed in 24 months including a POSH (prevention of sexual harassment) program; a monthly newsletter Disruption Chronicles, The aGeek series, and others.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A robust </span><b>Communication Design program,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interspersed with video and animation, especially on their 26 weeks Maternity Leave Policy conveyed through two curated mailers with graphics caught the attention of the employees. The outcome: the employee strength doubled to 1,800 at Amadeus Labs.</span></p>
