				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Adelaide, Kangaroo Island and Barossa in South Australia are not commonly considered as holiday destinations for Indians. Awareness of this region was amplified when Adelaide hosted the India vs Pakistan match during the ICC World Cup 2015. The challenge before The Practice was: To leverage the momentum from the World Cup match to drive more  visitors to South Australian destinations and to position the region as a destination of choice for Indian tourists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of our sustained online strategy attracted a 71 per cent increase in fans, 18X spike in organic reach and a 10X jump  in organic engagement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At first, we developed a message map, which helped us to zero in on unique offerings of five key destinations. Under our <b>Strategic Media Relations program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we drew on opportunities like the shooting of a popular Hindi TV series at Adelaide, Baross and Kangaroo Island</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to attract arrivals; and announcements of SATC investment programs in India to target trade and financial media. In two years, we had organized 11 familiarization trips for the media, which included </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Geographic Traveller </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Times Life</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our strategic brand positioning solution translated into 170 stories for our client garnering over 1.4 billion impressions and AUD 8 million in PR value. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our <b>Stakeholder Engagement program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on deploying key social media influencers in the lifestyle and cricket space to reach our target audience comprising of honeymooners, independent travellers and cricket enthusiasts. We executed three influencer campaigns over two years, which led to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">30-50k likes per post and over 400 million media impressions. The main objective of our </span><b>Digital Engagement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign was to boost engagement for each post on the official South Australia Facebook page in India.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of our sustained online strategy attracted a 71 per cent increase in fans, 18X spike in organic reach and a 10X jump  in organic engagement.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
The Handloom School (THS) is a non-profit organization born of the need to preserve India’s handloom industry which is under threat. When power looms were introduced and mass-produced textiles became more commercially viable, they grabbed a huge market share.  Unfortunately, this spelt doom for the traditional handloom weavers of India. Many weavers started looking at alternate livelihoods. Handloom weaving became a dying art. THS intervened and developed a specialized education program for young weavers. The idea was to bring handloom weavers back to the fold and to bridge the gap between traditional weaving and new competencies. </p>
<p>
To get recognition for this program, THS had to promote its case to relevant stakeholders and get their support.  THS identified The PRactice as the perfect partner to reach out to people and organizations who could further the cause. </p>
<blockquote><p>The organic, no-marketing-dollars-spent Social Media campaign was hugely liked by readers and the engagement grew by 800%. The weavers of The Handloom School received orders worth Rs.13 lakhs during the fashion week. </p></blockquote>
<p>
As part of our Stakeholder Engagement program, we identified  The Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) as a key influencer and made a pitch to promote handloom weaves from Maheshwar. The Director of FDCI was convinced by our pitch and THS was offered complimentary participation in the Amazon India Fashion Week (AIFW), 2017. We went the extra mile and initiated a parallel tie-up with Good Earth who agreed to sponsor the event. The collection was presented at Amazon Fashion Week, as the lead ramp show on March 15th, 2017. </p>
<p>
Our strategy included <b>Message Development, Strategic Media Relations, Digital Engagement, Communication Design and Stakeholder Engagement </b> as solutions. The outcome was incredible. Leading publications carried detailed stories about India’s unique handloom art. Over 98 lakh impressions were generated! The organic, no-marketing-dollars-spent Social Media campaign was hugely liked by readers and the engagement grew by 800%. As a result of the activities, awareness grew, and the weavers of The Handloom School received orders worth Rs.13 lakhs during the fashion week. What’s more,  the WomenWeave Charitable Trust also worked with us to launch of a collection of handwoven textiles.</p>

The state of Rajasthan is widely acclaimed for their majestic royal palaces, forts, camel caravans, textiles, and festivals. Yet, there was an unexplored side to Rajasthan, which the  Department of Tourism was keen to promote.</p>
<p>
The PRactice’s mandate: to reposition the brand by changing the tourist’s perspective of Rajasthan and promote the unexplored destinations of Rajasthan. We took a dual approach: to sustain positive conversations around  brand positioning and drive Rajasthan’s diverse offerings that include wildlife, food, adventure tourism, culture, heritage and luxury experiences. Secondly, we had to inspire more travellers to visit uncharted destinations.</P></p>
<blockquote><p>We took a dual approach: to sustain positive conversations around  brand positioning and drive Rajasthan’s diverse offerings that include wildlife, food, adventure tourism, culture, heritage and luxury experiences.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Our <b>Strategic Media Relations program</b> focused on familiarization trips designed around the new positioning. Each familiarization trip included a combination of freelancers, media publications, bloggers and photographers to impact a larger audience across different media channels. We leveraged key festivals and events like Jaipur Lit Fest, Rajasthan Diwas, Pushkar Festival, Jaipur photo Festival and celebrity visits to the state for occasions; capitalised on trade shows and on key airline partnerships like Air Asia&#8217;s new flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jaipur. </P></p>
<p>
In a span of six months, we had organized 11 media trips, which included two familiarization tours with international freelance media, key authors and personalities from the Jaipur Lit Fest. We had successfully initiated effective, organic feature stories on the seldom seen splendors of the state. Our <b>Strategic Brand Communication program</b> achieved the desired outcome  &#8212; we ran up 1,000 media stories and 150 million media impressions on the lesser known face of Rajasthan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
<b>Brand Communication programs</b> for Maple had to initially cut through trial inhibitors such as limited awareness about pure maple syrup from Canada. Viewed as an expensive product, the brand was not easily available as well. The PRactice’s objective was to enhance market penetration of the brand to 100 per cent in India and position it as a nutritive, gourmet product. To achieve this, we launched a <b>Strategic Communication program</b>, which focussed on amplifying health, nutrition and culinary benefits of maple syrup. This strategy was brought to life through direct to consumer activations, digital engagement, media relations and stakeholder engagement. Annual market study and perception audits were conducted as well to customise marketing and promotional strategy in India.</p>
<blockquote><p>The PRactice’s objective was to enhance market penetration of the brand to 100 per cent in India and position it as a nutritive, gourmet product.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Our<b> Strategic Media Relations program</b>included successful collaborations with leading English newspapers to run syndicated articles, and with a TV channel and radio to promote maple dishes. Our <b>Stakeholder Engagement program </b> vigorously tapped key influencers &#8212; chefs, nutritionists, bloggers and celebrities (Sonam Kapoor, Malaika Arora Khan Jacqueline Fernandez etc.,) to champion maple syrup as a healthier option on their social media handles. In just three months, from September to December 2017, we had reached over 31.5 million people purely through the celebrity stories.</p>
<p><b>The Digital Engagement program</b> initiatives concentrated on strategic amplification of news coverage through different social media platforms. We targeted 35,000 people but we achieved a fan base of 209, 838 on Facebook and notched up 1,84, 998 YouTube views in the course of one year. The Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers conducted a consumer audit in India and their findings were significant: the awareness of maple syrup in India had shot up from 17 per cent  in 2016 to 37 per cent in 2017.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reva Electric Car Company was all set to manufacture and launch India’s first compact, affordable electric car. Positioned as an alternative, environmentally friendly and intelligent solution for urban transport in India, the Bangalore-based company wanted to go national with this objective. However, there were powerful lobbies in the petroleum and automobile sectors, who were campaigning against the electric vehicle, within the government and the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve its objective, it was imperative to connect the car company with all the relevant stakeholders in the electric vehicle ecosystem. Working closely with the Reva team, The PRactice identified various stakeholders including the Delhi state government, environmental lobbies and pressure groups, influencers in government, media and among consumers. The PRactice connected with the Delhi Chief Minister, Ms. Sheila Dikshit’s office to align Reva’s positioning with the state government’s Clean and Green solutions campaign. This interaction resulted in a 15% concession for those who purchased the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reva &#8211; Delhi Government partnership became central to a high-visibility electronic media campaign by The PRactice. It was followed up by an extremely successful consumer launch of the REVA in New Delhi. Three hundred consumer calls in Delhi alone were received the day following the launch and coverage was received in 25 print publications, 40 online outlets and 14 broadcast stations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The REVA-Delhi Government experience is considered a fine example of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing insightful approaches to sustain complex and dynamic stakeholder relationships and is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an industry benchmark for the electric vehicle category to track and replicate.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bengaluru International Airport Limited, (BIAL) is located in the city’s suburban area. In May 2008, it replaced the old HAL Airport which was located within city limits. Although it was on par with the best of international airports, the new airport initially faced flak from anti-BIAL lobbies, the public, flyers, sections of the media and others with vested interests. In the middle of this anti-BIAL blitzkrieg, The PRactice was brought on board to improve perceptions and establish a positive corporate reputation for the client. We studied existing conversations in parallel forums and realised that most of them were based on half-truths. We advised the client to launch a communication campaign which debunked the myths and half-truths. We launched a simple, yet credible </span><b>Strategic Media Relations </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">program, ‘Seeing Is Believing’, as part of which, influential bloggers and journalists were offered free trips to the airport, to have a first-hand experience of BIAL. What resulted was that bloggers and journalists started writing about the positive experience. Myths were shattered, and the truth emerged.  When the airport was inaugurated amidst much fanfare and support from the media and public at large, The PRactice was acknowledged as a key facilitator, by the client. ​ We went on to partner with BIAL and build the client’s reputation through a </span><b>Digital Engagement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programme for many years.  Leveraging our rich experience in </span><b>Public Relations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we effectively managed BIAL’s reputation as one of the most professionally run private-public partnerships in the country. </span></p>
